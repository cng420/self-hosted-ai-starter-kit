         HAT IS SUPPLY CHAIN
        MANAGEMENT?
    A strong health system cannot function without a well-designed, well-operated, and well-
    maintained supply chain management system—one that can ensure an adequate supply of
    essential health commodities to the clients who need them.

    According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) —

    	    “Supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of all activities
           involved in sourcing and procurement…and all logistics management activities. Importantly,
           it also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which can be
           suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers. In essence, supply
           chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across
           companies.”

    Logistics activities are the operational component of supply chain management, including
    functions such as quantification, procurement, inventory management, warehousing,
    transportation and fleet management, and data collection and reporting.

    Supply chain management includes the logistics activities plus the coordination and collaboration
    of staff, levels, and functions, with the ultimate goal of aligning supply and demand. A public
    health supply chain is a network of interconnected organizations or actors that ensures the

    SUPPLY CHAINS INCREASE PROGRAM IMPACT
    If a supply chain provides a reliable supply of commodities, more
    people are likely to use health services. Customers feel more confident about the health program
    when there is a constant supply of commodities—it motivates them to seek and use services.
    Figures 1.1 and 1.2 show the program impact of improved product availability. In figure 1.1, as the
    availability of a mix of contraceptive methods improves, the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR)
    for the public sector increases. Studies have demonstrated that when a choice of contraceptive
    methods is available in health facilities, more women use contraception. When more women
    use contraception, it affects a number of key public health indicators—maternal mortality, infant
    mortality, and total fertility rates all decrease.

     	   • Whether consumables and vaccines should be delivered jointly
     	   • Whether transportation routes should be optimized for more efficient movement of products

     Using the analyses, designers can better understand the impact and, most importantly, the
     trade-offs of certain decisions. The analyses also can help them reach agreement on key design
     options that best achieve the strategic objectives agreed upon at the beginning of the process.

     Once the elements of the system are designed, the next step is to define the business
     processes required to operationalize the design. The business processes are the set of linked
     activities required to get products to customers at health facilities. These include the processes
     to place orders and to fulfill those orders, among others. Then, individual and organizational
     roles and responsibilities should be developed relative to each business process. This
     information will form the basis of standard operating procedures (SOPs) or a similar document
     that details the system operations.

     Finally, an implementation plan should be developed as part of the design, and include
     key activities, timelines, estimated costs, and roles and responsibilities required to implement

     assumptions; and recalculating the total commodity requirements and costs, as needed. For the
     quantification exercise to be useful and effective, the forecasting assumptions and the supply
     plan should be reviewed at least every six months; and more frequently for rapidly growing or
     changing programs. The forecast and supply plan should be updated whenever new data are
     available - whether this is the status of a shipment, updated consumption data, or updated stock
     on hand data. Ideally, the same core team of people who conducted the initial quantification
     should conduct routine updates. Many country programs have instituted a quarterly quantification
     review process for specific commodity categories such as ARVs. Ongoing pipeline and supply
     plan monitoring and updating of the quantification is critical to keep program managers, donors,
     and other stakeholders informed on the availability of drugs; is required for timely decision-
     making about product selection, financing, and delivery of commodities.

     Reviewing and updating the quantification includes the following activities:
     	    • Updating the actual consumption for each product, and comparing the actual consumption
             against the forecast consumption to determine the forecast accuracy
     	    • Reviewing and updating the forecasting data and assumptions
     	    • Calculating or recalculating the forecasted consumption using Quantimed, Excel

     		Are there any alternatives or substitute products or suppliers? What is the extent of
           product differentiation? Specifically for health commodities, are there branded (patented)
           products or generic products? Are there any quality standards segmenting the products?

     	 • Value as a customer
     		What is the procurement’s market share and attractiveness and hence the leverage as a
           customer for the suppliers?

     	 • Prices
     		Inputs on pricing are valuable, especially for budgeting purposes. The procurement unit
           can research pricing using reference prices, historical prices, and existing relationships
           with players in the market other than the suppliers. Even if the procurement has existing
           relationships with suppliers, they should refrain from directly reaching out to these
           suppliers before and during the bidding period until a contract is awarded because of the
           transparency and fairness requirements in public procurement.

     The Request for Information (RFI) and Request for Expression of Interest (RFEOI) are very useful
     tools similar to Request for Quotes (RFQ) and Request for Proposals (RFP), except that the RFI’s
     purpose is strictly to get information, and both do not directly lead to the award of a contract. The
     RFI’s and the RFEOI’s main purposes are to:
     	    • Develop a clearer understanding of the market
     	    • Stimulate interest and assess the market for interested parties
     	    • Align the technical requirements with the market’s capacity
     	    • Help determine the most appropriate procurement approach

     6.3.4        CONTRACT AWARD
     The contract is the outcome of the bidding process; it is the document which legally binds
     the purchaser and supplier to an agreed-upon set of commitments made through the tender
     document, the bid, and the subsequent communications, negotiations, and agreements between
     the parties.

     The procurement unit should inform unsuccessful bidders in order to:
     	    • Foster good relations with the suppliers
     	    • Establish a reputation for openness and transparency
     	    • Encourage unsuccessful bidders to bid in the future
     	    • Help prevent costly and time-consuming protests

                   ONTRACT AND PERFORMANCE MONITORING
     Contract monitoring and performance are necessary to ensure that the supplier is ultimately
     meeting its obligations so that products arrive on time and in good condition. A contract
     monitoring system:
     	    • Ensures that the technical specifications and contract requirements are met, especially in
             terms of quality, price, schedules
     	    • Enables the purchaser to identify any potential issues, changes, and conflicts
     	    • Evaluates the supplier’s overall performance

     This system should include the following at a minimum:
     	    • Timeline of the key milestone of the products’ supply
     	    • Pre-shipment document review

      following questions:
      	    • What is the ideal distribution network, given current transport resources? Will it provide a
              satisfactory service level, without stockouts, at dispensing facilities?                                                                     Distribution Center

      The points listed below are essential for any transportation network design, regardless of the size
      or complexity. By analyzing this information, you will be able to determine suitable transportation
      routes for delivery sequence and frequency to each facility. You can then use this information to
      identify the efforts and resources that could build an ideal distribution system.
      These points include:                                                                                               1st Delivery Point                1st Delivery Point                 1st Delivery Point

      The more sophisticated tools and robust data are available, the more specific and granular the
      KPIs can be (see Chapters 7, 8, and 10 for specific KPIs particularly applicable to inventory control;      Useful criteria for key metrics include that they

      However, there is often an intricate relationship among KPIs which can be challenging to                    by various entities and therefore is somewhat
      decipher. Further, disagreement can arise over which KPI takes precedence over another and                  comparable when assessing performance. A valid

      Tasks within the supply chain field are often not considered a professional role requiring
      specialized training. As such, they are shifted to any number of personnel without considering

      poor supply chain management.

      Collecting financial data can be a challenge depending on how readily available the information
      is, and this must be taken into consideration when planning a costing study. A costing study                                                                                                                                              IT equipment &

      COMMON FUNDING SOURCES OF PUBLIC HEALTH SUPPLY CHAINS
      SC costing analyses are essential for determining the operational and capital resources that the
      organization requires to operate the supply chain effectively in accordance with its mandates
      and customer expectations (see Figure 11-8). These analyses are also critical to help understand
      and inform the various sources of funding that are used to support these combined recurrent and
      capital costs. Common sources of funding include:                                                                                                                                                                                          HCW time to

      	    • Government allocated assets                                                                          	        • Mark up on sales                                             Storage space                                                         IN REVEW

      Once supply chain managers have completed these analyses, they are well equipped to
      determine a feasible scheme for matching requirements with assets and commitments and
      identify possible revenue sources and advocate for funding.

      donor partners when the cargo arrived and providing proofs of delivery, delivery quantity             redundancy. Multiplicity can help supply chains weather short and medium-term distribution

                                                                                                            performance problems, a parallel system might help maintain commodity availability by absorbing
                                                                                                            required capacity. These parallel systems may exist in a given context due to specific response to

      A core aspect of successful risk management requires process development for handling risk            pursuit of efficiency through options-building. In any of these cases, local managers should be
      incidents as they occur. As mentioned above, supply chain managers cannot address all risks           aware of parallel capacity and the potentially helpful role it can play in emergencies.
      due to resource limitations, or may not have the level of control required to address the source
      of certain risks. Instead, managers should develop and implement processes for identifying,
      responding to, and learning from risk events as they occur.

      Some events may be predictable enough that they require specific response plans. In these
      instances, managers can work with their teams to map out a relevant response approach in
      terms of who is responsible for which actions, and how the response is triggered initially.
      Other events which may not have been foreseen in the risk management could benefit from
      general emergency response plans. For these incidents, management may not be able to craft
      responses in advance, but can at least document actions that will help staff mobilize required
      resources as quickly as possible. In both instances managers should institute a learning agenda
      by reviewing results after each incident, documenting outcomes, and adjusting response
      protocols as needed.

      Incident handling plays a key role in response to disease outbreaks, where the health system
      (and subsequently the supply chain) is tasked with rapid delivery of services to recipients in
      variable and challenging contexts. The unpredictable nature of these outbreaks implies that the
      response cannot be handled by the routine supply chain alone, but that special planning and
      response approaches are needed to meet specific demands.

      In Liberia, following the 2013 Ebola outbreak which completely disrupted existing supply
      channels, healthcare partners including the MOH, developed a standard kit to be pushed to
      healthcare facilities in absence of consumption data. These kits were assembled and distributed
      through a dedicated channel that required close coordination among partners to ensure no
      facilities were missed by distributions, and close interaction with local authorities to facilitate
      delivery and storage in resource-limited environments. Successful delivery of commodities to
      health care workers confronting the Ebola outbreak required unique coordination and delivery
      capacity developed in response to the onset of the outbreak.

      ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR RISK MANAGEMENT
      Beyond formal risk management as outlined above, supply chain managers can incorporate risk
      management principles into other aspects of process design and execution. When designing
      an LMIS or regulating the roles of logistics service providers, for example, consideration of risk
      management approaches to limit the likelihood or reduce the impact of adverse events can help
      performance in the long run.
