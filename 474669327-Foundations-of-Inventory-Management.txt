iIIiII::d States of       During the making of this book I have often reflected on my good fortune-so many fine

-system,
                          people helped me, directly or indirectly. Here I can express only a small fraction of my
                          gratitude to them.
                               My grandparents were four quite different people, but they shared certain qualities-­
                          all were extraordinarily generous and remained cheerful even in harsh circwnstances. They
                          were very proud of us, their children, and grandchildren, and they would have been proud
                          to see this book (never mind whether it deserves such pride). My late mother was a source
                          of strength, warmth, and humor to all around her.
                               My father has taught me many things, but two especially come to mind. He showed
                          me the importance of carefully analyzing things, oflooking below surface appearances.
                          And, he demonstrated the importance of empathy and interest towards all people. I have
                          not always been the most responsible or responsive son, in these respects among others,
                          but give the man credit, he tried.
                              My wife Karen and my children Joe and Leah patiently and graciously endured
                          countless hours when I occupied myself with the computer screen instead of them. For
                          that, and for their constant love and support, I am deeply grateful.
                                How can I adequately thank the great teachers I have learned so much from? The
                          faculty ofthe lEOR Department atthe University of California, Berkeley, introduced me
                          to the field of Operations Research. I wish to thank especially C. Roger Glassey, William
                          Jewell, the late Ronald Shephard, Donald Topkis, and Ronald Wolff for encouraging my
                          fledgling efforts and tolerating my many mishaps. Later, during my doctoral studies at
                          Yale University, I was fortunate to receive the guidance and encouragement of Ron
                          Dembo, Donald Brown, Eric Denardo, and Ward Whitt, among others. lowe special
                          thanks to Harvey Wagner, whose wisdom played a great role in forming my under­
                          standing of the field. Finally, to my advisor and mentor, Matthew 1. Sobel, who gave so
                          much of his time and effort to my dissertation work and taught me so much about the
        99-40847          tasks and meaning of scholarship, and who kindly put up with all the egregious nonsense
                          I subjected him to, I offer my heartfelt thanks and appreciation.

            I have had wonderful colleagues, first at Columbia University and later at Dnke Uni­

       versity.lowe a special debt of gratitude to my research collaborator and friendAwi Fed­
       ergruen. Side by side we fought many battles, intellectual and otherwise, and from them
       I learned much about science and life.
            This book grew out oflecture notes and assignments for courses I have given at Co­
       lumbia and Duke over the last 18 years. It represents my view ofthe key concepts of in­
       ventory management-how they really work and why they really matter. Chapter I sets
       forth the goals of the book more fully.
            To the students who suffered through those courses, I offer my apologies and thanks.
       Their questions and suggestions contributed greatly to my understanding of the subject
       and to the coherence of this book. And what superb students I have had! I cannot resist
       mentioning in particular Shoshana Anily, Mark Ferguson, Arie Harel, Oded Koenigs­
       berg, Sang-Bum Lee, Yong-Joo Lee, Agues Pena-Perez, Antony Svoronos, Michal Tsur,
       Weirning Zhang, Shaohui Zheng, and Yu-Sheng Zheng. The greatest joy of my profes­
       sionallife has been to watch you grow to surpass at least this one of your teachers. (My
       apologies also to future students, whose wrists and minds this book may strain.)
            Very special thanks go to Jing-Sheng (Jeannette) Song, former student and now col­
       laborator, friend, and true scholar. Over the years she read many drafts and offered count­
       less suggestions for improvement, and the book is much better than it would have been
       without her efforts. Moreover, her continuing encouragement and (mostly) gentle prod­
       ding helped to counter my habitual sloth. Finally, after learning a few tricks from me, she
       has taught me much more, from the technical to the philosophical, by both precept and
       example.
           Sincere thanks to the reviewers of the book, whose suggestions were so helpful:
       Harry Groenevelt, University of Rochester; Ananth V Iyer, Purdue University; Hau L.
       Lee, Stanford University; Kamran Moinzadeh, University of Washington; Steven Nah­

    1.1 Inventories Are Important-So Are Foundations
               1.1.1 Inventories Everywhere
              In the desk in my office, in the bottom right-hand drawer, I keep pads of lined paper. I
              use a lot of paper in my work. About once a month I go to the supply room to get more.
              These trips are mildly irritating. I would hate to have to go every time I need a sheet of
              paper, or even a single pad. On the other hand, I never take more than a few pads. Why?
              Well, my desk is full of other things, and my oflice expense budget is limited.
                   Change of scene: I'm driving through a steel plant on an island in Tokyo Bay. On
              my right is the company's inventory of coal. It's stored outside in piles, each about 4 m
              high. There are thousands of these piles, stretching as far as the eye can see. (Question:
              Why do they need so much coa\? The answer will come later.)
                   That stack of paper is one familiar example of an inventory. Every one of us deals
               with dozens of inventories daily, usually without thinking too hard about them. Even at
              home we stock supplies offood, soap, and many other items, because they make life eas­
              ier than it would be otherwise. We don't keep too much, however, because otherwise we
              would run out of room or money. Thus, we are all familiar at an intuitive level with the
              need to manage inventories.



                                                                                                      1

2   Foundations ofInventory Management


         Large enterprises too, like the Japanese steel company I visited, need to manage in­
    ventories. Often, doing that well spells the difference between corporate success and
    failure.
         None of this is new. InventOly management is hardly a modem innovation. The earli­
    est humans kept caches of food and stone tools. As for recorded history, well, the whole
    business started with inventOly management-writing was invented, it seems, for that very
    purpose. Readers familiar with the Bible will recall that Joseph was, among other things, a
    remarkably proficient inventory manager. (True, he did enjoy some unusual advantages­
    intimate access to senior management, not to mention a superb forecasting system.)
         Returning to here and now, the person who runs the supply room has a different
    viewpoint on inventories. This operation serves about 250 busy, demanding people, and
    provides several dozen types and sizes of paper, as well as hundreds of other kinds of of­
    fice supplies, from paper clips and staples to computer diskettes. It takes a serious, con­
    scious effort to monitor all these items, to estimate their usages, to order new supplies
    from our office-supplies wholesaler at the appropriate times, to decide when to discon­
    tinue rarely used items and when to add attractive new ones, and so forth. These are the
    typical concerns of inventory management at the retail level; the operators ofmost retail
    stores face basically the same set of problems.
         Behind the supply room and the retail store lies the vast global network of industry,
    evelY part of which is permeated by inventories. Consider what has to happen before I
    obtain my small stack ofpaper: Wood-products companies maintain inventories ofgrow­
    ing trees; paper companies keep logs waiting to be processed; the logs are transformed
    into wood pulp, which is made into paper at paper mills; finished paper is held in in­
    ventory at the mills themselves and then at one or more warehouses, until it reaches the
    wholesaler; from the wholesaler's stocks the paper is sent to our supply room, where I
    pick it up. (As for paper clips, some of that Japanese steel may end up in them.)
         Even this picture is simplified: Between these steps there are inventories in transit,
    floating on rivers or carried in ships, trains, or trucks. In addition, wood is only one of
    the components of pulp and paper; a variety of other inputs (mainly chemicals) are also
    needed, all of which are stored as inventories before they are used. Finally, the com­
    plexities of scope are enormous. There are thousands of different types, grades, sizes,
    and colors of paper, for example.
         The management of these manufacturing inventories involves many of the same is­
    sues as a retail operation, but with a different emphasis. One key difference is that pro­
    ducers have to coordinate inventory-producing and -conswning activities at several re­
    lated processing stages and locations; logs, chemicals, pulp, and paper must be managed
    in concert for the overall system to work.
         A similar story could be told about every single item we use at home or at work (in­
    cluding paper clips). We could not eat or drink or bathe or keep warm, were it not for a
    huge, intricate chain of production and distribution activities, all of them fed by diverse
    inventories of raw materials, components, spare parts, and finished goods.
         Inventories are also critical in the service industries, a fact you may find surprising.
    After all, a service, according to one popmar definition, is something you can't drop on
    your foot. Haircuts, brain surgery, auto insurance, college teaching-none of these can
    be kept in a warehouse until needed. Nevertheless, the provision of any service depends
Chapter 1   General Introduction                                                         3

on a supply chain of supporting materials and equipment,just as much as a manufactur­
ing process does. Fast food restaurants could not operate without inventories offood; the
airlines would be grounded without their inventories of working aircraft engines and jet
fuel.
      The scale of all these inventory-related operations is simply immense: As of
March 1999, businesses in the United States held about $1.1 trillion worth of inven­
tories. This is about 1.35 times their total sales for the month. (This figure does not in­
clude all the stocks carried by governments and not-far-profit agencies.) Changes in
inventories, by industry and in aggregate. are watched closely by economists and re­
ported in newspapers, for these numbers are closely associated with the overall direc­
tion and health ofthe economy. Stocks of particularly critical items (such as crude oil)
make front-page news.
      At the individual company level, inventories are if anything even more important.
Customers do not easily forgive shortages or delivery delays, and for good reason: From
the customer's viewpoint a shortage may mean a minor annoyance (if the supply room
doesn't have my favorite kind of paper), or a severe disruption (if the steel company runs
out of coal), or even life and death (in the case of medicines). For some products in SOme
situations occasional shortages can be tolerated, but generally too-frequent shortages can
erode a company's reputation and market position. On the other hand, bloated stocks are
a serious drain on a company's financial resources. Short-sighted attempts to correct
these extremes, through frequent production changes or emergency orders, often just
make matters worse. Either widespread shortages or slow-moving inventories (and often
both) are clear signals of a company in trouble.
      We have understood for some time, at least in principle, that sound, careful inven­
tory management is critical to a finn's strategic viability. Recent events have sharpened
our appreciation of this fact, however: One of the most significant developments in the
world economy over the last two decades has been the extraordinary success of Japan­
ese companies in Western markets for automobiles, machine tools, copiers, and numer­
ous other products. Among the key factors underlying this phenomenon seems to be the
ability of Japanese firms to operate with substantially lower inventories than their West­
ern counterparts. Thus, inventory has become one of the dimensions upon which com­
panies compete on a global scale. Many of the success stories of the last few decades in
retailing (Wal-Mart), automobiles (Toyota), computers (Dell), and other industries are
founded on operational capabilities that, among other things, keep inventories lean.
      Question: Why are internet retailers like Amazon.com growing so rapidly? Answer:
They can operate without the huge inventories that retail stores require. (Anyway, that's
part of the answer.) This is one example of a broader phenomenon: Innovations in inven­
tory management enabled by technology can lead to the restructuring of entire industries.
      Commercial enterprises are by no means the only ones concerned with inventory
management. The crucial functions of a hospital depend, among other things, on reli­
able supplies of medicines, surgical equipment, blood for transfusions, bedpans, and
many other items. Armed forces must stock ammunition, spare parts of all sorts, food
and clothing. etc. Napoleon's famous quip, "An anny travels on its stomach," can be
reasonably read as an assertion of the importance of inventory management in mili­
tary operations.
4   Foundations oJlnvenfory Management


          Now, why does that Japanese steel company need so much coal? Because they ship
    it in from Australia. A steel company in Germany, situated near a coal mine, needs a far
    smaller inventory. Both are acting reasonably.


    1.1.2 Principles and Practice
    As its title suggests, this book focuses on the foundations of inventory management. Let
    us take a moment to think about what this means.
          First of all, there is a remarkable claim inherent in the title. The book is not about in­
    ventories ofpaper, specifically, or about coal; nor is it about ball bearings, photo film, com­
    puter screens, automobile door handles or insurance forms. It is not about Western or East­
    ern inventories or inventories carried by large or small organizations, in the public or
    private sectors. Rather, it is about inventories of all of these items in all these places and
    more, inventories in general. That is, there are fimdamental principles, general concepts,
    basic ideas, that underlie the management of inventories per se. transcending the apparent
    differences in the physical nature of the items involved and in organizational and geo­
    graphical circumstances. Such differences do matter at some level, of course, and another
    reason for exploring foundations is to discern which are the essential differences and why.
          Many of these ideas have implications beyond the realm of inventories as we usu­
    ally think of them. For example, an order backlog is not exactly a physical stock, but as
    we shall see it can be usefully viewed in very similar terms. In fact, this connection is
    crucial in understanding how both inventories and backlogs function.
          Ranging a bit further afield, we would not nonually regard a pile ofgarbage or other
    undesirable waste as an inventory, but the principles developed here can be usefully ap­
    plied to waste management nonetheless. Likewise, consider a portfolio of securities.
    This is somewhat like an inventory, insofar as both are stores of value that evolve over
    time. So, it should not surprise you to learn that, at the level of basic principles at least,
    inventory management and financial management are quite closely related. (hnportant
    and interesting as such connections are, however, we shall touch upon them only in pass­
    ing. The main focus will remain inventories in the usual sense.)
         More broadly, the subject of this book is the science of material processing systems,
    or supply chains-how to describe and classify them, how goods and information flow
    within them, how to manage them, and how to design and improve them. Inventories are
    important features of such systems, but not the only ones.
         These principles, concepts, and ideas, furthenuore. really are fundamental and ba­
    sic; they are important. If you learn them well, you will come to understand the central
    issues of supply-chain and inventory management better than you did before, and this
    knowledge will serve you well as a manager, analyst, engineer. consultant, or researcher.
         The development of these principles and ideas has been pursued vigorously for most
    of the twentieth century. They represent an extraordinary intellectual achievement, to
    which many people have contributed, people from all over the world, including academ­
    ics, professional engineers, aud managers. Also, while the field will doubtless grow and
    evolve in the future, it is likely that such developments will build on the foundation es­
    tablished so far. We can be reasonably confident that these basic ideas will have contin­
    uing validity and value for years to come.

               We pay a price, however, to delve deeply into fundamental concepts, to achieve a
          broad scope of generality. These basic ideas are abstract, and an abstract language is re­
          quired to express them clearly. Specifically, we shall employ the language ofmathemat­
          ics throughout the book, and you will need to be fairly conversant with it to follow much
          of what we have to say. Just how conversant you need to be will be explained a bit later.
          I have tried to keep the mathematical demands ofthe book to a minimum, hut these min­
          imal demands are still fairly hefty.
               Also, the focns on foundations means there are many practical aspects of inventory
          management that lie outside our scope. Day-to-day inventory control involves a myriad
          of details that we cannot hope to cover. There are no pictures of billing invoices in the
          book. Our discussions of such matters as forecasting and database management are
          sketchy, and there are even some (like warehouse layout) that we do not touch at all.
          (Chapter 2 treats some of these topics briefly.) Thus, the book is not intended to be a
          complete guide to the practice of inventory management.
               Do not read this as an apology. Billing invoices have become obsolete in many in­
          dustries, replaced by electronic data interchange (EDI). To set up an inventory database,
          or any database for that matter, you must know something about its purposes, what func­
          tions it is expected to accomplish. The varied tasks of management make no sense with­
          out an intellectual framework, a foundation. Without a foundation, we are prisoners of
          habit or hyperbole, unable to see opportunities for fruitful change or limits to change.
          That foundation is what this book seeks to provide.
               Another name for our subject is inventory theory. This label has the advantage of
          brevity, and I do use it here sometimes for that reason. But it is rather unfortunate, be­
          cause it connotes something ethereal, quite removed from practical concerns, interest­
          ing perhaps, but irrelevant. As [ shall try to convince you, that is not the case. I do be­
          lieve in the saying, ''Nothing is more practical than a good theory."


1.2 About the Book
          1.2.1 What and Whom Is the Book for?
          This book is intended, first and foremost, as a course textbook. It is designed to be used
          as the basic text for courses on the theory of inventories, offered by schools of manage­
          ment and engineering for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.
               To explain further, the focus of the book is on the formulation, analysis, and use of
          mathematical models of inventory systems. The book thus presumes a fairly strong tech­
          nical backgrowld, and while it aims to take students closer to applications than many the­
          oretically oriented texts do, it is by no means a complete guide to the management of in­
          ventories, as indicated above. In particular, the book is probably not an appropriate text for
          a basic course on inventory management for undergraduate or professional masters-Icv'el
          business students, though it may serve as a useful backgrowld reference for such a course.
               The intended audience comprises doctoral stud~nts in management, industrial en­
          gineering, and operations research, along with wellpprepared professional students in
          those fields. Students in other areas (especially economics and some of the other engi­
          neering disciplines) where inventories are important may also find the book of value.
6   Foundations ofInventory Management


         When during their programs should students take such a eourse? The nature of the
    field makes this question problematic: Inventory theory draws on vITtually all of the ba­
    sic methodologies of operations research, so ideally students should already be familiar
    with at least the rudiments of optimization theory, stochastic processes, and dynamic
    programming, On the other hand, the subject is much more than a collection of miscel­
    laneous illustrations of those methodologies, as explained further below; indeed, it has
    its own intellectual core. Also, because its focus is close to applications and practical
    managerial concerns, it can serve as a powerful motivator for further learning in ad­
    vanced methodological courses. Furthermore. the material covered in the course under­
    lies a good deal of the research literature in operations management and industrial engi­
    neering broadly construed, not just in the inventory area.
         As the theory itself tells us, when faced with contradictory criteria, the best solution
    is a compromise. (Well, sometimes.) In my experience the course works best for most
    students early in the second year of graduate study; the book is designed primarily for
    students with that level of preparation. There are exceptions, however: The course can
    also work well for first-year graduate students, and even undergraduates and MBA stu­
    dents, provided they have solid technical backgrounds and are able to learn some things
    on their own. And, of course, it is never too late.
         Partly to accommodate students with diverse preparations, and also to provide in­
    structors with a degree of flexibility in designing the course, I have included fairly ex­
    tensive appendices to make the book self-contained, or nearly so,
         For similar reasons I have adopted a somewhat mixed approach toward mathemati­
    cal generality and rigor. There are some theorems and proofs in the book, included with­
    out apologies: One ofits purposes, certainly, is to expose the basic techniques of research
    in the field, Also, the proofs often embody insights that cannot be conveyed fully other­
    wise. I have, nonetheless, tried to motivate these arguments as best I can, and very often
    I forego full generality in favor of simplicity, Also, I have tried to identify and encapsu­
    late the more difficult and technical material, so that instructors can choose to work
    around some of it without losing continuity.
         In addition to constructing a pedagogical device, I have also aimed to convey cer­
    tain ideas to my academic and professional colleagues-and to students as future col­
    leagues-which I hope they will find interesting, useful, or at least provocative, This is
    a book with a message, indeed a mission.
         First, the book comprises what I view to be the fundamental concepts of inventory
    theory as it now stands, the core, the backbone. Besides its function as a textboo~ it is
    designed to serve as a reference on the subject for practicing professionals and academic
    researchers. While some of these concepts have been around for decades, many are
    treated in nonstandard ways or revived here after long neglect, and others are products
    of quite recent research.
         In forming this selection I have necessarily had to omit much of value and interest.
    I have tried to compensate somewhat for these omissions in the notes and the problems
    following the chapters, (Still, I remain painfully aware of how many beautiful and sig­
    nificant results I have been unable to include; I hope my colleagues will accept my pro­
    fuse apologies on this score.)
         Also, the book expresses, in some cases impljcitly, certain judgments and convic­
    tions concerning the connections between these concepts, the relation of the field to
                                                                                      ,,-,-~   .........­

    users (like the general level of the economy). The same supply and demand processes,
    moreover, typically affect many other kinds of paper and other goods as well.
          Nevertheless, this is a "sefid abstraction, and we shall refer to it repeatedly through­
    out the book.
          For one thing, this basic structure can be used as a building block to compose dia­
    grams of much larger, more complex systems. Figure 1.2.2 suggests some of the possi­
    bilities. Here, two difterent components are procured and then assembled or mixed to
    form one final producI, which is then shipped to three separate stocking locations.
          Indeed, one critical distinction among inventory systems rests on their degrees of
    structural complexity: There are some inventories that can be reasonably, plausibly viewed
    in the simple terms of Figure 1.2.1 by itself, independently of other items in other places.
    There are other cases, however, where multiple items and/or locations are essential, where
    the distinct inventories in the system cannot sensibly be considered in isolation.
          Even as it stands, Figure l.2.1 expresses a fundamental point about inventories in
    general, their '"between-ness": To understand what an inventory does. how it works, why
    it is held, the basic functions it performs, and to begin to think seriously about how to
    manage it effectively. we must first understand the basic characteristics of the supply and
    demand processes that drive it. Indeed, the real subject ofthis bookis supply and demand
    and the transactions between them. Inventory is just one aspect of supply-demand inter­
    action, albeit a crucial one.
          To appreciate this point, it is helpful to imagine a situation where an inventory is not
    needed and would serve no useful purpose. For this to be so, we would have to find (or
    design or adapt) a supply process capable of providing instantly the exact amounts
                 Chapter J   General Introduction                                                            9

                 needed to fill the demands arising from the demand process. Furthermore, such a per­
                 fect supply process must be not just physically possible, but also reasonably inexpensive
                 to build and operate.
=and
                      The possibility and practicality of an ideal supply process, of course, depend in part
                 on the nature of the demand process. For example, if we could be sure from the begin­


J
               ning that demands will occur at a regular rate, with only minor variations over time, then
                 a supply process capable of providing goods at that same rate, and of responding imme­
                 diately to variations within the expected range, would do the job.
                      No such perfect match exists in the real world, but there are situations that come


J
               close: Most of us do not keep an inventory of cold water in our residences. Our sinks and
                 tubs are connected to a very effective supply process, the network of pipes. pumps, and
                 reservoirs that make up the public water system, which normally meets virtually all of
                 our domestic demands. These demands are not regular at all, but the supply process is


J
               easily controlled to respond to our demands, by opening and closing the valves we call
                 taps. (Of course. it is only in the industrialized conntries and only quite recently that such
                 modem water systems have been created; elsewhere and in earlier times, people do and
                 did keep inventories of water, to minimize trips to the well.)
                      This example of water serves as a nice paradigm for the notion of perfectly matched

                 supply and demand processes. lfwe can envision an ideal supply process, we can further
                 imagine attaching it directly to the demand process by means of pipes and valves. We
                 would then have a system where the product flows directly from the supply system to
                 meet the demands.
d processes,           In most situations, unfortunately, supply and demand processes cannot be matched
                 perfectly; most products do not flow smoothly in this way. Indeed, most of the important
illy through-    functions of inventories can be understood in terms of the various types of mismatches
                 that arise between supply and demand processes. In other words, inventory serves as a
IXIlpOse dia­    buffer hetween supply and demand processes that do not fit neatly together, to mitigate
,fthe possi­     the costly disruptions that would otherwise occur. The most obvious type of disruption
ocmixed to       is a shortage, a failure to !Deet demand as it occurs; inventories are often held, then, to

10   Foundations of [nventOly Management


     A good part of this book is devoted to Wlderstanding these factors and their interactions,
     but for now we explain each one briefly:
          Smooth or lumpy demand: When demand can be envisioned as a continuous stream.
     drawing down inventory at some rate (constant or variable), then we say demand is
     smooth. Lumpy demand, in contrast, occurs in large, discrete chunks. (Of course, these
     two are extreme cases; real demands often have both smooth and lumpy components.)
     Even smooth demand can lead to a mismatch, depending on the nature of the supply
     process, as explained below. Normally, lumpy demand increases the difficulties further.
          Variations in demand over time: Seasonal changes in demand, and other temporal
     variations, often lead to mismatches, especially when the capacity of the supply process
     is severely limited. Then, inventory must be built up during slack periods to have suffi­
     cient stock to meet later, heavier demands. Even with virtually unlimited capacity, how­
     ever, the presence of other complicating factors (supply leadtimes and demand uncer­
     tainties, for example) means that temporal changes must be anticipated somehow.
          Unpredictable demand variations: Random fluctuations in demand, in conjunction with
     supply leadtimes and capacity limits, are among the major reasons for maintaining wento­
     ries. In these cases, the supply process is unable to respond quickly to unanticipated demand
     surges and declines, so inventory is needed in order to fill demands in a timely manner.
           Economies ofscale in supp(V: In many situations the technology and economics of
     the supply process favor long production runs or large deliveries, relative to short-tenn
     demand. Examples include long production setup or changeover times and shipments
     over great distances. Also, if we purchase goods from an independent supplier, the sup­
     plier may simply charge less per unit for a large order. Thus, even if it is possible to sup­
     ply small quantities, it may be expensive. This explains why even smooth demand can
     lead to a problematic mismatch. In such cases there will be sizable inventories for some
     time after a batch is produced or a shipment received.
           Capacity limits: Every real supply process has limited capacity, and so has limited
     ability to respond to changes or lumps in demand, whether anticipated or not Thus, in­
     ventories are required to compensate for this inflexibility. Capacity limits are more sig­
     nificant in some cases than others; often they can be safely ignored for practical pur­
     poses, but just as often they cannot.
           Delays in response-leadtimes: As mentioned above, supply leadtimes and demand
     fluctuations together lead to shortages, unless inventories are held to prevent or at least
     mitigate them. When the leadtimes themselves are unpredictable, these difficulties be­
     come even more severe, for the same reasons.
           Imperfect quality: Imperfect quality exacerbates many ofthe problems discussed so
     far. Defects waste precious capacity, and they add elements of uncertainty to the supply
     process, somewhat like random leadtimes.
           There are other reasons to hold invcntory besides these supply-demand mismatches.
     For example., gold and other precious metals are used as inputs to certain production
     processes, but some people own them for purely speculative reasons, hoping their prices
     will rise. In retail settings inventories often serve a marketing purpose; customers want
     to examine goods before buying. Most of our attention here, however, will be focused
     on mismatches such as those described above.

interactions,        Once we understand the characteristics of supply and demand, we can design a good
                 inventory strategy. But, the job of management does not stop there. We must then step

parity, how­     systems. One of the crucial functions of inventory, to protect against unforeseen contin­
nand uncer­      gencies, simply does not arise when supplies and demands are (or can be usefully re­
oebow.           garded as) predictable. Only in the stochastic case must we be concerned with all the is­

     1.2.3 Guiding Lights
     Several principles have guided the writing of this book. These ideas have grown gradu­
     ally out of the process of teaching this material over the years, from discussions with
     hundreds of practicing managers, and througb shared reflections with colleagues and
     students. It is worth reviewing them briefly here, for otherwise some of the selections
     and treatments of topics may seem merely eccentric.

     1.2.3.1 Inventory Theory Is a Coherent, Unified Body of Knowledge
     This is partly an assertion and partly a goal or ideal. Inveotory models (like inventories
     themselves) come in many different shapes, sizes, and flavors, and the techniques used
     to analyze them are equally diverse. At first glance the field appears to be a motley col­
     lection of unrelated topics, each a special case of some larger subject, such as dynamic
     programming or queuing theory.
          Yet there are common ideas, concepts and methods that link the central model for­
     mutations. There are threads linking the most abstract theory with practical methods. For
     example, consider the simple but powerful idea of viewing backorders as the mirror im­
     age of physical stock. This notion underlies the analysis of supply leadtimes, through the
     construct of the inventory position (because the dynamics of the inventory position are
     linear in a key sense). This approach cuts across the distinctions between deterministic
     and stochastic demands and between continuous and discrete time. To make clear the gen­
     erality of this idea, I have introduced it much earlier than usual, in the context of the
     economic-order-quantity (EOQ) model in Chapter 3. Later, in the context of stochastic
     demand, we are led naturally to a fundamental obsetyation, that leadtimes and random de­
     mand fluctuations have their greatest impact in combination. (Also, the breakdown of this
     approach in the lost-sales and certain other models explains why they are so difficult.)
          For similar reasons I have tried to point to several other subsequent developments
     during the treatments of the EOQ model and its cousins, which consequently are slightly
     more elaborate than usual. 1 regard this as a small price to pay for continuity. Likewise,
     I have emphasized the interplay between the classic equilibrium analyses and the equally
     classic dynamic-programming fonnulations of Part III, which are usually presented as
     entirely distinct approaches.
          More generally, as will be evident from a perusal of the book's contents, 1 have
     sometimes grouped and sequenced familiar topics in somewhat unusual ways. to clarify
     what I feel are the key structural relationships between them. 1 hope that 1 have revealed
     structure, not imposed it.
          Unity is a good thing, but it can be overdone. While stressing coherence, I have also
     tried to suggest the richness and variety of the field, especially through the problems. (I
     recommend that students read all the problems, not just those assigned as homework.)

     1.2.3.2	 Inventory Theory Is Strengthened through Its Connections to
              Other Disciplines
     This principle might seem to contradict the previous one, but I do not think it does.
          Within operations research, as mentioned above, inventory theory has long­
     standing ties to most of the other subdisciplines, ties that have enriched all of these

                     subjects. In certain cases I have emphasized these connections somewhat more or dif­
                     ferently than usual, however.

                          In particular, 1 have highlighted the connection between inventory theory and the
:ussions with
                     theory of queues. In this respect the book revives a tradition established in the classic
.lleagues and
                     work of Morse [1958] (or rather continues the revival begtm by Heyman and Sobel
:be selections
                     [1982] in a somewhat different manner). For queueing theory remains our richest source
                     of models for what 1 call here supply processes. Recent developments in both fields (for
                     instance, the flowering of queueing-network models, and the "discovery" of the effects
                     of batching on congestion and leadtimes) further enhance this interaction_ In addition, 1

     economics of inventories. When it is reasonably convenient and natural, it is a good thing
     to show stodents that what they are learning is part of a broader body of knowledge, not
     an isolated island of technique.

     1.2.3.3 Advances in Technology Have Radically Changed What Is Practical
     This should come as no surprise. We hear constantly that computers and communica­
     tions technology have transfonned our lives. Our thinking, however, often lags behind.
     In particular, many of the standard tools of inventory control were developed at a time
     when the only "practical" computational methods were those that could be carried out
     with a slide rule and statistical tables, with data that could be collected manually in a
     short time. This is nO longer true, to put it mildly.
          These changes have influenced the book in a variety of ways. Generally, I have tried
     to strike a balance between past and futore, to say enough about standard, current prac­
     tice (regardless of whether or not it is good practice) that students can understand it, even
     while indicating where I feel better methods or approaches are now available.
          For example, I give far less weight to normal approximations than previous writ­
     ers have done. I do include them, partly because they are indeed widely used, and
     partly because the properties of the normal distributions facilitate certain modes of
     analysis, but no/ because they are more widely available in tables than others. Anyone
     today can easily and cheaply buy and run programs to evaluate virtoally any conceiv­
     able distribution.
          For similar reasons I downplay manual solution methods, when standard reliable
     codes are widely available. It may be that students will not understand these methods as
     deeply as those of us who have performed them on paper, but I believe their time is bet­
     ter spent on other things.
          More fundamentally, I have not hesitated to suggest the implementation of fairly
     large, complex models and methods requiring extensive data and number crunching. The
     availability of these resources is rarely an issue today, as noted above. (There are other
     reasons, of course. to try to keep models simple.)
          Obviously, no one will read the current state oftechnology and its implications pre­
     cisely as I do. Also, the future will no doubt bring further changes, and what we do to­
     day will then likely seem old-fashioned. Well, that's progress. The best we can do is to
     try to adapt, keeping our sights as clear as we can.

     1.2.3.4 Inventory Management Is More Than Inventory Control
     The world has changed in other ways as well. OUf view of the scope of inventory man­
     agement, in particular, has broadened substantially. Thirty years ago, say, inventory con­
     trol was seen as a fairly static, technical function. The technology embodied in the sup­
     ply process was regarded as stable, demand was viewed as, if not quite predictable, then
     at least fairly regular in its fluctuations, and both were detennined externally, by the en­
     vironment or by managerial decisions at a much higher level. The job of inventory con­
     trol was to understand these processes and to detennine appropriate responses to them
     in the form of control policies. (This is an exaggerated picture, but still not an unfair
     one.) Most of the models and analyses of inventory theory up to that time were devel­
     oped to support the inventory-control function as thus conceived.

                    changed. For example, it has been suggested, frequently and seriously, that the ITT ap­

                    lot sizes should be scrapped. This is utter nonsense. What is true is that, if we succeed in

here are other           Likewise, the kanban system is often promoted as a radically different and superior
                    substitute for the control methods addressed by the models. This view rests on a misun­
~tionspre­
                    derstanding of the kanban system, the earlier methods, or both. In fact, the kanban sys­
mat we do to­       tem is a variant ofcertain older methods, perhaps an improvement, but a variant nonethe­
I~   can do is to   less, and its use does not fundamentally change the issues of inventory management.
                          True, the kanban system can be implemented with less centralized short-term in­
                    fonnation and control than we are accustomed to, and this is important, for it has led us
                    to rethink the whole issue of effective implementation in fresh terms. Nevertheless, the
n-entory man­       key managerial decisions (setting production rates and numbers of kanbans, for in­
im-entory con­      stance) involve the same logic, the same economic tradeoffs, as traditional systems of
ied in the sup­     control. (To anyone who thinks these concerns don't matter in Japan, I strongly recom­

          Third, in managing a supply chain, it is not enough to know that reducing leadtimes
     is a good thing. Even a network of modest size may include thousands of items over
     dozens of locations. In each case there may be many possible alternative improvements,
     some of them costly, some not. The key questions, then, arc where should improvement
     efforts be focused, and what are the anticipated benefits? Similar questions arise con­
     cerning all sorts of other operational improvement projects. Managers, engineers, and
     analysts, whether or not their jobs arc primarily concerned with inventories, are being
     called on to answer such questions with increasing frequency.
          The models and methods of inventory theory, in my view, constitute the most accu­
     rate, tractable, thorough, and reliable set of tools now available to address questions of
     this nature. To use the tools for this purpose, however, requires a shift of focus. Most of
     the models, as noted above, are explicitly addressed to the problems of control, given all
     the environmental parameters. We need to ask further, what are the effects of changes in
     these parameters? This style of parametric analysis is certaiuly not new; it falls under the
     heading of sensitivity analysis. In the pastJ however, sensitivity analysis played a rather
     minor role in most expositions of the models. I have placed considerably greater em­
     phasis on it.

     1.2.3.5 Inventory Theory and Inventory Practice Are Closely Linked
     This is another ideal. Yet, I believe there is far more actual truth to it than is commonly
     realized, partly because of the changes in technology and the roles ofinventory managers
     discussed above. Although there are differences in style and vocabulary between the ac­
     ademic and the managerial cultures, they are less than they were a generation ago. and I
     do not regard them as fundamental. The ultimate concerns of theorists and practitioners
     are the same.
          In any event I have tried to bridge some of those gaps here. Notwithstanding the
     warnings abovc concerning all the book does not purport to do, I remain mindful of the
     fact that, with very rare exceptions, today's students of inventory theory will someday
     have to talk to managers (or future managers). Thus, where possible, I have tried to ex­
     plain how certain commonly used heuristic techniques appear when viewed from the
     perspective ofthe theory, and, conversely, how certain ideas derived from the theory can
     be and are used, sometimes in less-than-obvious ways.
          A case in point is the discussion of material requirements planning (MRP) in Chapter 5.
     A glance at that section will immediately reveal that it stops far short of a full exposition of
     MRP on its own terms. Much of the MRP vocabulary and virtually all of its specific tech­
     niques are missing. The purpose here is rather to present the basic structure of the model un­
     derlying MRP and its overall approach to production control and to relate these to structures
     and approaches addressed in the theory Viewed from this somewhat distant vantage point,
     the disjunction between MRP and other methods seems far less sharp than it may appear
     closer up. The goal, then, is to provide a framework within which this and other popular tech­
     niques can be comprehended; the details can be learned elsewhere.

     1.2.3.6 Coping with Inventories Requires Both Management and Engineering
     Do inventories fall under the purview of management or engineering? This sounds like
     a clear-cut question. The training and the daily activities of managers and engineers are

oos arIse con­                  In my view the subject of inventories is one place where the arts and sciences of

                                Modem inventory theory began with the derivation of the EOQ formula by Harris
                           [1913], an engineer. inventor, and lawyer. Over the next few decades, numerous varia­

          These pioneers were certainly aware of the need to plan for uncertainties. However,
     the rigorous analysis of models with explicitly stochastic features really began in the
     1950s, starting with the seminal papers of Arrow, Harris, and Marschak [1951] and
     Dvoretzky, Kiefer, and Wolfowitz [1952]. High points ofthis work are represented in the
     books by Whitin [1953], Arrow, Karlin, and Scarf [l958], Morse [1958], and Holt,
     Modigliani, Muth, and Simon [1960]. Most of the basic analytical methods of the field
     (dynamic programming and stationary analysis, for example) were established during
     this period, as were the research-oriented journals in which this work increasingly ap­
     peared.
          The classic, mouumental text of Radley and Whitin [1963], a comprehensive sum­
     mary of the field to that date, represents the culmination of this period, in a sense, and it
     has had a profound effect on all subsequent developments. Appearing shortly afterwards,
     the survey of Veinott [1966a] was also influentiaL Much of the work on single-item,
     single-location models since then can be seen as elaboration and extension of the ideas
     set forth in these works. This is not to say that nothing important has happened; the cu­
     mulative effect of these elaborations and extensions has been a substantial broadening
     and deepening ofthe field.
          The study of complex systems with multiple items and stocking locations has pro­
     gressed somewhat more slowly. Research along these lines began in the late 1950s and
     has continued actively ever since. See Scarf, Gilford, and Shelly [1963] for a collection
     of influential early papers. The achievements in this area up to about 1970 are summa­
     rized in Clark [1972], and those of the following decade in Schwarz [1981]. Many im­
     portant results are quite recent and appear here for the first time in book form.
          Good recent surveys of the research literature can be found in Porteus [1990] and
     the reviews collected in Graves et aL [1993] and Taynr et aL [1999]. Chilean [1990] has
     compiled an extensive bibliography.

                   2.1 Introduction
                              This chapter provides a brief overview of the context of inventory management. It
                              touches on some oftlle information technologies used in operations, who in the organi­
                              zation should be concerned with inventories and how they should interact with others,
                              etc. It also presents some observations on models and their uses.
                                   Inventory management employs a wide range of information technologies. These
                              include databases, cost accounting, and statistical forecasting. It is important that you be
                              conversant with these technologies, at least enough to be an intelligent consumer of
                              them. This chapter provides a brief account of what they do, how they relate to inventory
                              management, and where to get more information about them.
                                   In this respect I am articulating an essentially conservative position. Many books
                              and articles about inventory management say or imply that you should do your m.. .' ll ac­
                              counting. forecasting, etc. Maybe so, 30 years ago. In those days many companies were
                              unsophisticated in their uses of these technologies. Since then.. however, the technolo­
                              gies and companies' uses of them have developed considerably. Today, in my view, it
                              makes no sense to develop, say, your own personal cost accounting system. You are un­
                              likely to do better than the experts, there are organizational and legal dangers in main­

2.2 Contexts
           2.2.1 Computer Systems
           Look at some inventory-control software. Ask to see the systems used in your company
           or wllversity. Go to a local retajl store, and ask whether you can see the system used
           there. On the World Wide Web (WWW), go to one of the shareware sites, and download
           a couple of the inventory programs. Try them out. Do a search for inventory software;
           many commercial sites have demonstration packages.
                Chances are that what you will find is, essentially, a database. It may be built on a
           general-purpose database program (e.g., Access, Paradox, Oracle) or on another type of
           application with database functions (e.g., Excel, 1-2-3). Even ifit is a stand-alone pro­
           gram, however, it will look and act much like a database.
                This is the beginning of wisdom about inventory control in practice. An inventory
           system is, first andforemost, a database. Such a system is structured as a database, and
           much of what it actually does is carried out through database functions.
                The simplest and most common inventory systems are structured around a collec­
           tion (or table) of items. These represent the goods available in a store, or the parts stored
           in a repair shop. The items are independent of each other. (Such systems are discussed
           in §§5.2 and 8.2. Later, we shall mention more complex databases, where the items are
           not independent.) There is a record for each item, containing basic descriptive informa­
           tion about it (name, code number, etc.). Typically, there are pointers to other structured
           information (e.g., a list of suppliers). In addition, there is a transaction history, includ­
           ing all orders, receipts, and withdrawals for each item; this is analogous to the ledger in
           a basic accounting system.
                What does the system do? Well, people enter transactions. They add, delete, and
           change items. They compile summary reports for management. In sum, they do all the
           things that people do with other kinds of databases.
                The quality and value ofthe system. moreover, depend to a large extent on how well
           it performs its database functions. Is it easy or hard to use, flexible or rigid, dependable
           or not? The answers depend entirely on the underlying database. People often complain
           about errors in inventory data, but that's true ofall data. Good database programs include
           error control capabilities, and these are precisely the teclmiques available to control in­
           ventory errors, no more and no less.
                Nevertheless, an inventory system is special in certain ways, namely, in the nature
           ofthe decisions and actions it supports. Specifically, an inventory system triggers orders.
           It may do so indirectly, by just signaling when an item's stock is low, leaving the action
           to a person. Or, it may place the order automatically. In either case, the system requires
           some logic to perform this task. (Other databases can support actions too; for example,
           a contact manager may indicate when it is time to phone a certain client.)
                This is where models, the subject ofthis book, come in. An inventory model, among
           other things, provides the logic required by a computer-based inventory system to trig­
           ger orders. Although the model typically is a tiny fraction of the code of the system, it is
           a very important part. A bad model triggers bad decisions, and bad decisions lead to fu­
           rious customers, irate suppliers, unhappy bankers, and stressed-out managers.
                    Chapter 2   Systems and Models                                                         21

                         By the way, this answers a question that students of inventory theory often raise:
                    How do you implement an inventory model? In most cases, the answer is simple: Code
                    it up, and insert the code into an inventory system built on a database. The database pro­
                    gram will take care of most ofthe technical difficulties that implementation entails (nice

22   Foundations oflllventmy Jl,fanagemeflt


           Mind you, monitoring can be tricky. Nearly every company adequately records
     sales, but demands are something else. A demand is a potential sale. But, if the goods
     are unavailable, the customer may go elsewhere. Even if the customer is content to wait,
     and purchases the goods when they become available, it is important to record the time
     of the original demand as well as that of the later sale. Otherwise, we will have a dis­
     torted record of the time-pattern of demand.
           In some situations it is easy to monitor demands. The customers of a catalogue re­
     tailer, for example, conununicate with the company only by mail or phone or email. so
     it is easy to record each such contact. whether or not it leads to a sale. Likewise. in most
     industrial markets, demands arrive in the fann of orders.
           In other situations, however. monitoring demands is hard or impossible. Consider a
     grocery store. If a customer enters seeking almond-flavored herbal tea, but the store has
     none. the customer will leave empty-handed or perhaps buy another flavor. There is no
     way to discern the customer's actual demand. There are special statistical methods to es­
     timate demands from sales data (e.g., Nahmias [1994]), but these are difficult.
           There are still other situations where demands can be recorded, but only with some
     effort. In a high-end clotlling store, for instance, the sales staff try to talk to every cus­
     tomer who walks in the door. If a customer wants something that isn't there, it is likely
     that a salesperson knows about it. The trick, then, is to train the sales staff to record such
     events. Infonnation technologies (e.g., with point-and-click item selection) can make
     this process easier.
           On the supply side, similarly, it is important to record when each replenishment order
     is placed and when it is actually received. (The difference is precisely what we call the lead­
     time. As you will find throughoutthe book, this is a very important driver ofperformance.)
     Obvious? Yes. Does everybody do it faithfully? No. Be sure that your organization does.
           Again, modem infonnation technologies make this task much easier and more reli­
     able than it once was. For example, bar-code scanners have vastly simplified the record­
     ing of deliveries.


     2.2.3 Organizafwnal Issues
     Suppose a company has two main divisions, production and marketing. Production
     makes the products, and marketing distributes and sells them. Who should manage the
     inventories of finished goods?
          One possible answer is production. They are the ones who actually make the goods,
     so it is natural that they control the end products. But wait: Those inventories are there
     to meet the needs of marketing, who use them to serve the ultimate customers. So, mar­
     keting should control the inventories. Here's yet another answer: Marketing people al­
     ways demand more of everything. and production people always make excuses for not
     doing what they promised. Who looks out for the firm as a whole and its owners? Fi­
     nance people, that's who. Let them manage the inventories.
          Or, since these existing groups can't seem to agree, why not set up a separate de­
     partment to manage the inventories? There's just one problem: Where should this de­
     partment be located, to whom should it report? Oh dear, it looks like we're back where
     we were before.

                               derstanding the world and a mode of problem solving. A good model can be beautiful as

I manage the                        Still, nobody really understands what a model is. Many have tried to define the term,
                               none satisfactorily to my mind. Part ofthe problem is that different fields use models in
I::e the goods,                different ways. Some ofthe models of physics (e.g., general relativity, quantum electro­
ries are there                 dynamics) are incredibly accurate depictions of the segments of reality they address.
as. So, mar­                   Those models essentially capture all our knowledge oftheir domains. The models of the
ng people al­                  social sciences, in contrast, are far less precise. They aim to capture some important
cuses for not                  broad features of their domains, while suppressing other less important details. In that

                               to leave out. Furthennore, engineers and scientists use models for quite different pur­

     always leave out more than they include, and their ultimate goal is practical utility, not
     pure knowledge. (This point, by the way, explains much of the unfortunate and some­
     times amusing misunderstanding between operations researchers and economists. The
     models they use are quite similar, but their purposes are altogether different.)
          Even among operations researchers there is quite a range of styles in making those
     design decisions. Some prefer to include as much relevant detail as possible, while oth­
     ers aim for simplicity above all. Inventory theory tends toward the latter style. Many of
     its basic models are radically simple. This approach, then, includes only the most im­
     portant features of the problem, suppressing everything else. It takes some getting used
     to, but it's effective. (I happen to think that these models are beautiful too, but you can
     decide for yourself.)
          There is another difficulty with the word model. People use it to describe both a piece
     of mathematics and a piece of computer software. These are different things. They may be
     related, that is, a computer model may implement a mathematical one. But, there are many
     ways to implement a given mathematical model, and the software always includes more
     than the mathematics. What you will find here in this book are mainly models ofthe math­
     ematical kind, though many of them have indeed been implemented in software.
          What else does the software implementing a model include? A model is a powerful
     but crude device. Because it omits much, some deviations between model and reality are
     inevitable, and a raw, naked model on its own may behave foolishly. To prevent this, it is
     often essential to surround the model with buffers, i.e., various functions to preprocess
     the data, postprocess the solution, and so forth. Most successful computer models are
     amply buffered in this manner.
          Finally, a word about applications. Many have observed that applying a model is
     fraught with difficulties. The main reason, I believe, is that a computer model is a piece
     of technology. Just like a new type of machine, a computer model requires people to
     learn different skills and to work with others in different patterns. Such adjustments are
     difficult, costly and time-consuming. It is no wonder that people are conservative in
     adopting a new computer model. The model may seem perfectly natural to its creator,
     but to the people who have to use it, it's a strange and threatening device. Furthermore,
     again like a new machine, a model has political implications; it will increase some peo­
     ple's power and reduce others'. This is certainly true in the inventory arena, which is in­
     herently political, as explained above.
          Indeed, a vast majority of successful applications have one thing in common: They
     have been used elsewhere first. Nobody wants to be the first to try a brand new technol­
     ogy. Tnlly innovative models are rare.
          If you understand these points and undertake applications keeping them in mind,
     your chances of success will improve considerably. I'm not saying never innovate. Just
     remember that every innovative feature of your model will require more effort in the ap­
     plication phase. And try to anticipate the technical and political difficulties your users
     will face in employing the model.


     2.3.2 Cost Estimation
     Many of the models in this book require cost factors-purchase costs, production setup
     costs, inventory holding costs, etc. Where do these come from? The short answer is, they

es your users       could we do better? It's hard to see how. The key point is to recognize that cost estimates, even
                    the most careful ones, are imperfect, and to use them with appropriate caution.
                         Stockout-penalty costs present a special problem. Whereas inventory holding costs,
                    say, are internal to the finn, a stockout mainly affects somebody else. One can measure
                    a holding cost (subject to the caveats above), but it is harder to imagine measuring the
duction setup       cost of a stockout to a customer. [n any case, accounting systems typically do not touch
nswer is, they      such costs.
26   Foundations ofInventOly Management


           Faced with this difficulty, many people simply give up. As we shall see, it is possi­
     ble to formulate an inventory model without stockout-cost parameters, using constraints
     instead, and those people find this approach more comfortable. If you are one of those
     people, rest assured, the book includes such fonnulations. My own view, however, is that
     this just translates the problem to different terms. The basic problem remains to under­
     stand what stockouts mean to customers.
          This is essentially a problem of market research. Fortunately, marketers have come
     to recognize the importance of customer response time and have devised methods to as­
     sess its importance to customers. (The methods are basically the same as those used to
     measure other dimensions of product quality.) We are rapidly passing beyond the point
     where the inventory analyst had to pick a number out of the air, whether a penalty cost
     or a constraint.
          Incidentally, the difficulties of cost estimation have influenced the structure of the
     book. There is an emphasis throughout on policy evaluation in physical terms, which
     doesn't require cost estimates, before policy optimization, which does. Policy evaluation
     is always useful, but especially when reliable cost numbers are hard to get.


     2.3.3 Demand Forecasting
     Inventories, among other things, are largely driven by forecasts, especially of demand.
     To manage inventories effectively, therefore, one must know something about demand
     forecasting.
           Here is my view on the matter: A forecast is one kind of statistical estimate. Fore­
     casting methods are statistical methods. To learn forecasting, therefore, study statistics.
           Of course, there is more to statistics than forecasting. Much of statistics concerns
     static or cross-sectional data, e.g., the fraction of people over 6 feet tall at one particular
     time. Many basic statistics books and courses focus on cross-sectional problems and say
     little about forecasting. Forecasting is about dynamic or longitudinal or time-series data. A
     forecast is a statement about the future, which no one has observed yet. Even so, the basic
     approach of forecasting is precisely that of statistical estimation in general: Take some in­
     formation you know and use it to estimate something you don't know. That unknown some­
     thing can be a parameter of a static population or a demand value in the future.
           For instance, you probably know that a point estimate is one particularnumber, the best
     (most likely or average or some such) guess for an unknown quantity. You probably know
     too that, while a point estimate is better than nothing, it is incomplete. It is wise to supple­
     ment a point estimate with some measure of its accuracy or precision, such as the sample
     variance or range. This is the rationale for interval estimates, like confidence intervals.
           Now, forecasts are often presented in the fonn of point estimates. "We expect de­
     mand next month to be 3508 cases." This is what people expect a forecast to look like.
     Even forecasters who know statistics consider their jobs to be the creation of such state­
     ments. But forecasts have different degrees of precision, just like other estimates, and
     the usefulness of any forecast is a direct function of its precision. This is true in general~
     and it is certainly true in inventory management. As emphasized throughout the book,
     one of the key drivers of inventory policies and performance is demand uncertainty, that
     is, forecast error. Without some measure of forecast accuracy, it is impossible to manage
     inventory intelligently.

e. it is possi­                  This raises another point about monitoring. To assess forecast accuracy, it is essen­
g constraints              tial to monitor actual demands, as discussed above. But it is equally essential to keep

3.1 Introduction
           This chapter undertakes a detailed exploration of the meaning and impact of economies
           ofscale in supply. Except for this characteristic. the supply and demand processes are as
           simple as they could be. The systems here are structurally simple too, involving a single
           product at a single location.
                Time and the product itself are both continuous, or in other words, infinitely divisi­
           ble. This is a modeling choice. In reality, products like orange juice, petroleum, wood
           pulp and bauxite are infinitely divisible, while airplanes, computers and steel mills are
           not. (3.62 gallons of orange juice has a specific value, but a fraction of an airplane is
           worthless.) Things like screws, finished paper, and medicine bottles are intemlediate
           cases; such items may be thought of as infinitely divisible tor some purposes, even
           though they are not really so.
                Demand for the item occurs at a known, constant rate, continuously over time; the de­
           mand over 1.672 years is precisely 1.672 times the annual demand rate. The complicating
           features of other demand processes are abstracted away: Demand is smooth, not lumpy;
           there are no variations over time, neither predictable nor unpredictable ones; et cetera.
                                                                                                  29
30        Foundations ofInventory Management


                The supply process is also simple. However, it cannot supply the item at the precise,
          constant rate of the demand process. Supply and demand are not perfectly matched, and
          they cannot be linked in an ideal flow system. Supply occurs in discrete batches or lots,
          because of its nnderlying technology and economics. Each batch, no matter how small,
          incurs afixed cost. This is the simplest form of economy of scale. (Much of the chapter
          is concerned with how large these lots should be; the topic is sometimes called lot siz­
          ing.) Also, the supply process responds to replenishment orders only after a fixed lead­
          time. As we shall see, this feature is not very significant here.
                We start with a very basic model in Section 3.2, the economic-order-quantity (EOQ)
          model. The key assumption is that demand must be filled immediately; stockouts are for­
          bidden. The subsequent sections treat important variations of this model.
                Section 3.3 relaxes the no-stockout assumption to allow planned backorders.
                The next three sections explore variants of the supply system. Section 3.4 focuses
          on a production process which produces the item at a constant, finite rate. This model
          incorporates a simple capacity limit. Section 3.5 treats more complex economies ofscale
          arising from quantity discounts. Section 3.6 examines the effects of imperfect quality.
                Section 3.7 refonnulates the EOQ model using a different cost objective. The EOQ
          model aims to minimize the long-run average cost over time. This new model is based
          instead on the present value of future costs. We then reinterpret the original EOQ model
          as an approximation to the new one.
                Many other variants of the EOQ model have been developed in response to diverse
          practical needs. Some are explored in the problems at the end of the chapter.
                The models of this chapter are highly stylized, with all their simplifying assump­
          tions, but they are nonetheless widely used in practice. Also, the methodology and the
          intuition we build up here will provide a solid basis for understanding the more elabo­
          rate and realistic models presented later.
                This chapter requires little mathematics beyond basic calculus.
                Before getting started, let us set forth some basic vocabulary: We need two units
          of measurement, a unit of time (days, months, years, etc.) and a unit of physical quan­
          tity (tons, bushels, gallons, etc.). For now we use the abstract tenns "time-units" and
          "quantity-units." In a real application, of course, we would choose specific units of
          measurement instead.


3.2 The Economic-Order-Quantity Model
          3.2,1 Setting the Scene
          Our task is to manage a single product at a single location over time. Demand occurs
          continuously at a constant rate:
                                       A ~ demand rate (quantity-units/time-units)
          Imagine that we start with some inventory. The inventory decreases at rate Aas stock is
          depleted to fill the demand. At some point, we must replenish the stock. To accomplish
          this, we send an order to the supply system. An order is a request for a specific amount

logy and the      fect, that the supplier has unlimited quantities available.) Subsequently, demands further
 more elabo­      deplete the inventory, and we continue to place and receive orders for supplies.
                       This scenario roughly describes the situation at a retail outlet, which receives fin­
                  ished goods from a supplier and sells them to customers; the leadtime represents order­
ed two units      processing and transportation time. With minor changes in wording, however, the same
~-sical quan­     model depicts a simple production process. An "order" becomes a signal to produce a cer­
e-units" and      tain amount. The entire batch is completed after L time units and then becomes available
ific units of     to meet demand. For example, L might represent the time required to procure raw mate­
                  rials and set up a machine, actual production being virtually instantaneous. (This story
                  presumes no capacity limit. Section 3.4 treats a limited-capacity production process.)
                        Figure 3.2.1 describes the net effects of supply and demand on inventory. Most of
                  the time, inventory decreases linearly with slope -t.... When we place an order, nothing
                  happens until L time units later, when the corresponding batch arrives. At that point, the

                       What would happen if we neglected to order, and inventory dropped to zero? After
                  that, for a while at least, we would be unable to meet demand. Such stockouts are for­
                  bidden: We always order far enough in advance that stock is available to meet all de­
                  mand. (Section 3.3 drops this restriction.)

i:me, denoted
                        To focus the search for answers, we make two further assumptions. First, subject
                  to the requirement that all demand be filled immediately, we never order earlier than
32   Foundations oflnventmy Management


     necessary. In other words. each order arrives precisely at a moment when we would oth­
     erwise run out of stock. (lbis is sometimes called the oero-inventory property.) Second,
     each order is of the same size. (These rules should seem reasonable. Problems 3.1 and
     3.2 provide rigorous support for them.)
          Define the following functions (measured in quantity-units) oftime t (measured in
     time-units) for t 2: 0:
                       I(t)   ~   inventory at time t
                      IO(t)   ~   inventory on order, the total stock ordered before t but not yet
                                  received by t
                      IP(t) = inventory position at time t = I(t)                + IO(t)
     This double-letter notation (f0 and IP) allows us to distinguish different quantities, all re­
     lated to inventories. By convention all these functions are right-continuous. For example,
     if an order arrives at time t, I(t) is the inventory after the arrival, not before. To indicate the
     inventory just before the arrival, write I(t-). Figure 3.2.2 depicts these functions.
          Also, let
                                          D = AL = demand during a leadtime
          Think of time t as now, so the current inventory is I(t). How does it change from t
     to t + L1 The new supplies arriving in that interval total exactly IO(t). and the demand
     is AL = D. Consequently,

                   There are two relevant criteria for the perfonnance of the system: We do not want to order
                   too frequently, because of scale economies, nor do we want to carry too much inventory.
bange from t
                   These guidelines are too broad to guide action; we need to translate them into more precise
I the dcmand
                   criteria. The approach here focuses on IOllg-rull averages over lime. (This fortnulalion
                   should seem natural. but Section 3.7 describes a different one.) The system operates forever,
                   over the time interval [0,00), and we measure perfortnance by the following quantities:
                                           7   = average inventory

                                               ~   lim T __ {(I/T)f6I(t) dt}

                                         OF    ~   order frequency
                                               ~ limT~~(l/T)(numherof orders                    in [0, T)}
                        Notice that in Figure 3.2.2 IP(t) and 1(1) are periodic. We can thus detertnine the
                   long-run averages I and OF by examining what happens during one cycle, the time in­
                   terval between the receipts of two successive orders. The length of eacb cycle is q/'A, and
                   there is one order per cycle. Therefore,

                                                                            1      _.A:
                                                               OF      = q/'A   - q

                       Also, during a cycle, let) decreases linearly from q to 0, so the average inventory
                   during the cycle is Xq. Thus,

                                                                       I   = 'Aq

                   We now have a simple formula for each performance measure.
                        Incidentally, we have implicitly assumed that inventory on order is of no coneem.
                   In effect, we take ownership of goods only when we actually receive them. (Otherwise,
34   Foundations a/Inventory Management




     if we pay on ordering, an additional tenn is needed in the total average inventory. This
     extra term happens to be D, a constant, independent of q.)
          Notice that 7 is increasing in q, while OF is decreasing. These frvo criteria are in
     direct conflict: We can exploit economies of scale in the supply process by choosing a
     large q, but this leads to large average inventory; we can economize on inventory, but
     only at the expense of a high order frequency.
           So, how should we select q? There are two basic approaches. Sometimes the world
     outside the model imposes a constraint on 7 or OF. Either the inventory or the order fre­
     quency cannot exceed a prescribed upper limit. In either case it is clear what to do: An
     upper bound on 1 implies an upper bound on q. So, to minimize OF, set q as large as
     possible, prccisely at its upper bound. Likewise, given a limit on OF, set q so as to hit
     the limit precisely.
           Without such constraints, the conflict remains. To resolve it, suppose we can trans­
     late the two criteria to a common scale, monetary cost. That is, we compute the costs en­
     tailed by orders and inventory, and combine them into an overall cost measure.
          To do this, we estimate cost factors for procurement and inventory holding. These
     cost factors remain constant over time. We measure all costs in some standard monetary
     unit; here, we use the abstract tenn "moneys." Specifically,
                    k    ~    fixed cost to place an order (moneys)
                     c   ~    variable cost to place an order (moneysiquantity-unit)
                    h    =	   cost to hold one unit in inventory for one unit of time
                              (moneysi[quantity-unit· time-unit])
     The definition of h means, in effect, that at time t an inventory of I(t) causes cost to ac­
     cumulate at the rate of hI(t).
          The estimation of these cost factors is discussed in Chapter 2 and elsewhere in the
     book. For now we mention a few basic facts: The fixed cost k represents all order costs
     that are independent of the order size. It typically includes administrative order­
     processing costs as well as transportation and receiving costs. In a production setting k
     may include a setup cost. Thus, k reflects economies ofscale in the supply process. The
     variable cost c comprises the unit purchase cost as well as any other costs that do depend
     on the order size. The total cost per order is thus k + cq.
          The holding cost h typically includes two major components. The first comprises all
     direct costs associated with inventory itself, including costs for physical handling, insur­
     ance, refrigeration, and warehouse rental. Denote all these direct costs by II. The second
     component is a financing cost (Xc, where a. is an interest rate, reflecting the fact that hold­
     ing inventory ties up capital. (Section 3.7 discusses this point further.) Thus, Ii = II + etc.
          These cost factors, along with the physical performance measures OF and I, deter­
     mine the average costs per unit time: The long-run average order cost is (k + cq)OF, and
     the average inventory-holding cost is hI The overall perfonnance criterion is the sum of
     these two quantities:

     EXAMPLE 3.2.A, PART 1

     You are responsible for paper supplies in the copying room in a medium-sized office. Paper usage
     averages 8 boxes per week. Each box costs $25. The shipping cost per order, regardless of size, is
     $50, and receiving an order takes about an hour OfyOUf time, which costs the company $80. Each
     order takes a week to arrive. The company figures financing costs at 15%. per year. Keeping the
     boxes organized costs about $1.10/week per box. Currently, you order 2 weeks' worth of supplies
     with each order. VVhat is the average cost of this policy? Use boxes, weeks, and $ as the units. In
     the notation above,

     3.2.3 The Optimal Policy
     The function C(q) measures the total cost for any possible order size, q. Our goal now is to
     find the optimal value of q, denoted q*, the one that minimizes this function. The plan is
     to apply a classic technique ofcalculus: Compute the derivative C(q) and equate itto zero.
          (This technique works only under certain conditions. Here, fortnnately, those con­
     ditions are met. The domain of C is the open interval (0, (0), and on that domain C is con­
     tinuously differcntiable and strictly convex. These properties imply that C (q) ~ 0 is nec­
     essary and sufficient for optimality, and the optimal solution is unique. See Appendix A
     if any of these notions is unfamiliar.)
          Here goes:
                                                   .                     kA     I

     This equation has the unique positive solution
                                                         q* = Y2kAlh                                             0.2.2)
     This fonnula is called the economic order quantity (EOQ). It is a truly fundamental re­
     sult: It is widely applied in practice. And, as we consider more complex settings later on,
     we shall encounter it and variations of it again and again.
         It is sometimes convenient to work with the alternative variable
                          u   =   time between orders, or order interval                           =    q/X.
     The entire analysis above can be conducted in tenns of u instead of q. In particular, OF =
     l/u and 7 = ;>Au. The average cost can then be expressed as a function of u. (A graph of
     this function looks just like Figure 3.2.3; since u is a linear transformation of q. we are just

                       the inventory position or time. (This notion can be expressed in a pleasant little rhyme:
                       Watch the stock or watch the clock.) In the context of stochastically varying demands,
                       however, time-based and quantity-based controls are quite different, as we shall see

                       3.2.4 Sensitivity Analysis
                       The simple fonn of the EOQ formula (3.2.2) allows us to address directly "what-if"
                       questions. Here is an important example: What is the effect on q* of a change in the de­

     The fonnula says that
          1. The optimal order size changes in the same direction as the demand rate, but
          2. The relafive change in the optimal order size is smaller than that of the demand
             rate (i.e., '1*'1'1* is closer to I than A'/A).
     Thus, if demand doubles (A'/A = 2), '1*' 1'1* is only               V2
                                                              = 1.414. In order to lower '1* by
     half ('1*' 1'1* = ~), A must decrease by 75% (A'/A = X).
          In other words, q* is robust with respect to changes in A. This is a crucial property
     in practice. In the real world, none of our assumptions will be fulfilled strictly. We must
     estimate A, and the estimate is virtually sure to contain some error. Nevertheless, pro­
     vided the relative error is not too large, the q* computed with the estimated A is close to
     the true value. Moreover, A is likely to change over time. Still, as long as the relative
     change is small, the '1* given by (3.2.2) remains useful. (Chapter 4 discusses this point
     in greater detail.) This robustness is one reason the EOQ formula is used so widely, in
     spite of the rather heroic assumptions on which it is based.
          These observations follow from the fact that '1* varies as the square root of A. Evi­
     dently, q* depends on the cost factors k and h in the same manner. Thus, q* is robust with
     respect to changes in k and h as well.

     EXAMPLE 3.2.A, PART 3

     For the   p~per   supply problem above, if    >...   increases from 8    to   12. then q* increases by the
     factor VI ;% 1.22, from 42 to about 51. Returning to A ~ 8, if we can reduce k fioml30 to 100 (by
     lowering the shipping cost, not your salary!), then q' becomes (l/W) (42) = 37.

         There is another sense in which the EOQ model is robust: Omit the variable pur­
     chase cost CA from C(q) and C* for the moment. Define the function

                                       E(X)   ~l    (x + li              X>o
                                               2              x/

     With a bit of algebra you can show (see Prob. 3.6) that

                                              CCq)
                                              C*
                                                          ~   E(-'q*L)                                  (3.2.5)

      Suppose we use the "wrong" value q instead of q*, because of errors in parameter es­
     timates, or additional constraints not included in the model, or any other reason. Then,
     the relative cost ofthis suboptimal policy, compared to the true optimal cost, depends
      only on the relative error in q itself, as indicated by (3.2.5). The formula is entirely in­
      dependent of the cost and demand parameters. « is sometimes called the EOQ error
     function.)
            Fonnula (3.2.5) always produces values greater than I (unless of course 'I = '1*).
      However, «x) grows slowly as x departs from I, so the relative cost penalty is small, pro­
     vided q is reasonably close to q*. For example, suppose we overestimate q* by one-third,
      so '11'1* ~ 4/3. Then, CCq)/C* = 25/24, a cost penalty of only 1/24 or just over 4%. The
      cost penalty is the sarne if 'I underestimates '1* by 25%, so '11'1* ~ 3/4.

                                This finding has another practical implication: It has been suggested that there are
rate, but                  advantages to setting lot sizes systematically lower than the EOQ model prescribes.

'" widely, in              nology for reducing setups. This is another element of the JlT approach; see Shingo
                           [1985], for example.) This will permit us to lower q and hence save on inventory hold­

;rohust with               we can use (3.2.4) to estimate the overall cost reduction. This approach is discussed fur­
                           ther in § 3.7 and Prohlems 3.7 and 3.27.
                                It is worth remarking that some parameters have no effects. First, q* does not de­
                           pend at all on the variable-cost parameter c. The intuitive reason is that the long-run
<eases by the
                           average supply rate must equal the demand rate A, so the average variable order cost
.30 to 100 (by             must be cA, a constant independent of q. (However, as mentioned above, h usually de­
                           pends partly on c, so changing c does change q* indirectly.) Also, neither q* nor C*
                           depends on the leadtime L. The leadtime merely introduces a delay between actions
,Mable pur­                (orders) and their effects. If the leadtime were to increase, we would need to order
                           earlier, but this would happen automatically via the trigger quantity D = AL in the or­
                           der rule. All this reflects the fact that, given the current inventory position, we know
                           exactly when we will run out of stock. Thus, according to this model, there is no ad­
                           vantage to reducing the leadtime. (Of course, such perfect foresight rests on the as­
                           sumption of perfectly known leadtimes and demands. As we shall see later, in a sto­
                           chastic system the leadtime does have an impact, and leadtime reduction is valuable
       (3.2.5)             indeed.)

"'cr 4%. The               3.3.7.) We always use any inventory on hand to fill demands; backorders accumulate
                           only when we run out of stock entirely.
40   Foundations ofbrfentory Management


          Of course, we could choose to operate the system without backorders by following
     the policy described for the EOQ model. Permitting backorders enlarges the set of fea­
     sible operating policies.
          Many businesses do operate with substantial backlogs. This is certainly true of
     capital-goods firms and the service industries. There, the products are expensive (or, in
     the case of services, impossible) to store. These are extreme cases~ but even in other mar­
     kets (industrial materials, for example) occasional backorders are pervasive.


     3.3.2 Reorder-Poinl/Order-Quantity Policies
     Let us define some new functions and redefine some of those used in Section 3.2:
                         I(t)    = inventory at time t

                         B(t)    ~   backorders at time t
                         IN(t) = net inventory at time t         ~   I(t) - B(t)
                         IO(t)   ~   stock on order at time t
                         IP(t) = inventory position at time t = IN(t)              + lO(t)
     The new functions are B(t) and IN(t), and IP(t) has a new meaning.
         The net inventory IN(t) captures the information in both I(t) and B(t): At any given
     time, at least one of those two functions is zero, since we use any available stock to fill
     demand. Therefore,

                                 IN(t) = ( I(t)           when IN(t) '" 0
                                           -B(t)              when IN(t) '" 0
     or
                                     I(t) = [IN(t)]+          B(t) = [IN(tW
     The definition of IN(t) treats backorders as negative inventories, and indeed they func­
     tion in this way: Between receipts of orders. IN(t) decreases at the constant rate A, re­
     gardless of whether IN(t) is positive or negative. When an order arrives, IN(t) jumps up
     by precisely q in all cases; some of the bateh may be used to fill backorders, and the rest
     is added to inventory. Thus, IN(t) behaves much like I(t) did before, when baekorders
     were forbidden, while now I(t) itself is more complex. See Figure 3.3.1. (IN(t) is some­
     times called the inventory level.)
          Also.
                                      IN(t   + L)   = IN(t)   + 10ft)   - D                  (3.3.1)

                                                    = IP(t) - D

     This relation is the direct analogue of (3.2.1), with INO replacing I(} It is the
     conservation-of-flow law for this system: Between t and t + L, IO(t) gets added to the
     net inventory, and D gets subtracted. Thus, IP(t) summarizes all the information needed
     to predict the net inventory a leadtirne into the future.

                  when to order is now more complex. We need a second policy variable in addition to q:
                                                    r = reorder point (quantity-units)

                  This variable can take on any real value, positive or negative. Consider the following
                  policy:

     cost for backorders, as in a contractual penalty for late delivery. For a variety of reasons,
     then, we need to measure and control backorders.
          The primary backorder-related performance measure is the following:
                                ]j = long-term average outstanding backorders

                                    ~ limT-+~{(l/T)J6B(t} dt}
     (The limit here is analogous to the oue defining 7.) There is another criterion which plays
     a secondary but still important role:
                A(t)   ~   1{IN(t) :5 O}
                A      =   long-run fraction of time out of stock, or stockout frequency

                       = limT-+~{(lIT)f[,A(t) dt}

     (Here, 1 {.} is the indicator function and A(t) is an indicator variable, taking the value I
     when IN(t) :5 0 and 0 otherwise.) Clearly, A also measures the fraction ofdemands back­
     ordered. Thus, the average number of demands backordered per unit time is i\.A, and the
     fill rate, the fraction of demands met from stock, is 1 - A. (Terminology alert: We often
     call]l the backorders for short. Because A measures the backorder frequency, however,
     some writers cali it the backorders) referring to Ii as the time-weighted backorders.)
           Let us now compute the criteria as functions ofthe policy variables q and 1: It is con­
     venient to replace r by the equivalent variable
                                                       v   ~   safety stock   ~   r - D

                    (The phrase safety stock suggests a positive quantity, but v can be negative! Still, this def­
                    inition is consistent with standard usage in stochastic-demand models. There, the safety
                    stock is usually positive.) Again, call a cycle the time between the receipts of successive
                    orders, and u the cycle time. Also, define a time-equivalent to V,

                                                                        .      v

                    Like v, y can be negative.
                         For any given q, only certain values ofv make sense: Equation (3.3.1) implies that
                    the net inventory 1N(t-) just at the end of a cycle is precisely v, so 1N(t) ~ v + q at the
                    beginning of a cycle. Therefore,
                         1. If v > 0, then for all t

                                                    l(t) > v > 0        and       B(t)   ~   0
                         2. Ifv < -q. then for all t
                                             l(t)   ~   0    and        B(t)   > -(v + q) > 0
                    Neither conclusion is appealing: In case 1, we have more inventory than we actually
                    need, and in case 2 we never fill all backorders. So, we can and do restrict attention to
                    the range -q::=; v::=; O. So, v is negative (more precisely, nonpositive), as isy, and each
                    arriving order fills all current backorders.
                         Thus, a cycle consists of two parts, one of length u + y = (q + V)/A, during which

                        These results are strikingly similar to those for the original EOQ model: The ex­
                   pression for C* includes the average variable cost cA, of course, plus the same square­
nit                root term as the EOQ model, but multiplied by the factor V-;;;. Since w lies between 0
                   and I, so does this factor. Thus, the optimal total cost is less than in the EOQ model. This
buve. The total    should come as no surprise: The solution to the EOQ model (with v = 0) is one feasible
                   solution to the model here. A wider range of solutions can only improve the total cost.
                        Also, g* is similar to the EOQ formula. The square-root term in (3.2.2) is divided
                   by v-;;;here, so the optimal order size is larger than in the EOQ model. The reason is a
                   bit subtle: For any given g, the order cost is fixed, but the variable v provides a degree of
                   freedom to adjust the mix of holding and penalty costs to achieve the best combination.
                   With this flexibility we can afford to take on more of these latter costs, by increasing g,

reason for this         It may be surprising that v* is always negative; every system should operate with
                   some backorders. But, imagine starting with v = O. A tiny reduction in v causes a tiny
                   amount of backorders, and only for a short period at the end of a cycle. This change re­
                   duces inventory, also by a tiny amount, but over nearly the whole cycle. Thus, even for

     EXAMPLE 3.3.A, PART 1
     Reconsider the paper supply problem above, assuming that backorders are allowed. This can mean
     that copying work waits when paper runs out, or you borrow paper from a neighboring copying
     roOID. In any case, you figure the backorder cost to be b = $15 per box-week. The other data are
     the same as before. Then, W = 15/(15 + 1.173) = 0.927, and    Y;;;  = 0.963. So, q* increases to
     42/0.963 or about 44, and v* ~ -(0.073)(44) = -3. Tbe optimal cost declines from 249 to C* ~
     200 + (0.963)(49) = 247.

          The sensitivity analysis of this model is similar to that of the EOQ model. Again, q*
     and C* are robust with respect to changes in A and k, because of the square-root opera­
     tions. Also, think of w as a relative-cost index, independent of h itself. With the param­
     eters viewed in this way, the optimal solution is robust with respect to w and h.
          Also, fix q to any value, and suppose we set the safety stock optimally, to v ~
     -(1 - w)q. Let C(q) denote the cost of this solution, excluding the term CA. One can

     This is precisely C(q) in the EOQ model, except for the adjusted inventory cost. The ra­
     tio C(q)/C* thus reduces to E(q/q*), as in (3.2.5). Consequently, there is little cost penalty
     for a modest deviation of q from q*. Now, suppose q = q*, but we choose v ¥- v*. The
     cost C(v, q*) is a quadratic function of v. Thus, a small deviation ofv from v* does not
     increase the cost much, but a large one does.


     3.3.5 Constrained Stockouts
     Backorders cause a variety of unpleasant effects, as mentioned above. The penalty cost
     b is supposed to represent all those negative impacts iu economic terms. It is not easy,
     however, to measure the economic value of keeping customers happy; b typically in­
     cludes intangible factors. Actually, estimating k and h is also difficult in practice, but b
     is no doubt the most problematic of the three cost factors. We discuss these measurement
     issues in Chap. 2.
          These difficulties lead us to consider alternative approaches to the control of back­
     orders. The most conunon is to impose a constraint on one of the service measures, usu­
     ally the stockout frequency:4 or the fill rate I -:4, foregoing explicit calculation of a
     backorder cost.
          So, suppose there is an upper limit 1 - (J.L on A, where 0 < uL < 1. The fraction
     w_ need not have any relation to a cost ratio like w; it is an exogenously determined ser­
     vice requirement. (Problem 3.12 asks you to explore a constraint on a different service
     measure.) The remaining total cost is CA + kOF + hI

lurion:                   To see the impact ofthis constraint, fix q for now, leaving v variable. The order fre­
                     quency OF is independent of v, so apart from A itself, the only relevant criterion is 7.
          (3.3.4)    Now, 7 is increasing in v, whileA is decreasing. So, starting from v = 0, we want to re­
                     duce v (thus lowering 7 and raising A) as far as the constraint permits. That is, set v =
xmtrols it any­      -(I - w_)q, so that A ~ I - w_. Thus, the inequality we began with should be satis­
                     fied as an equality. At this value of v, 7 = Xw':q.
                          Recall, the solution to the cost-optimization model above yields the similar identity
                     (3.3.4), A ~ I - w. The cost ratio w plays the same role there as the fill-rate limit w_.
:i This can mean     Assuuting we set vas above, the total cost becomes (3.3.5), with w': replacing w. With

48   Foundations ofInventory Management


          The average inventory I is related similarly to what we call the average stocking
     time, denoted IW, the time a unit of physical goods remains in inventory, from the mo­
     ment its order is received to the instant it is used to fill demand. That is, II).. = [w. (The
     reciprocal of the stocking time 1/ IW= 'A/I is called the inventory turnover, or turnover
     for short. This measure is widely used in practice.)
          These connections suggest an alternative way to think about the tradeoff between
     performance criteria: Instead of the physical quantities measured by I and 8, we can fo­
     cus on the equivalent time measures IWand BW. In these tenns, we can choose to re­
     duce customer waiting by keeping stock on hand longer. The order frequency OF is just
     the reciprocal of the cycle time u, which is already a time-oriented measure.
          These are more than mathematical tricks: An inventory or a backlog is the net result
     of the interactions between the times of various events. For example, [(t) is the number
     of physical units whose arrivals (due to order receipts) precede t, but whose departures
     (due to demands) occur after t. In a very real sense, all o.finventory management con­
     cerns the management oftime. (The time dimension is crucial in other managerial are­
     nas as well; see Stalk and Hout [1990].) This perspective underlies the specification of
     inventory-related cost factors such as h, as discussed in Section 3.7.


     3.3. 7 Costs for Backorder Occurrences
     We now explore a variant of the model, using the stockout frequency A as the
     customer-service criterion instead of B. That is, replace bB by bA in the definition of
     C. [Of course, b has an entirely new meaning here. For instance, suppose we incur a
     cost b' each time a demand is backordered. Set b ~ )"b'. The average stockout cost is
     then b'()"A) ~ bA.]
          The optimal policy is peculiar: Either never allow backorders (v* ~ 0), or never or­
     der at all and let all demands be backordered forever; provide perfect customer service,
     or get out ofthe business altogether. Furthermore, a small change in the model's param­
     eters can flip the solution from one case to the other.
          To see this, first note that v should lie between -q and 0, for the reasons cited above.
     Assume for now that v' < O. Solving aClav = 0 leads to v ~ blh - q. Substituting this
     into C(v, q) yields the cost function
                                                          2k1..h - b2

     There are two cases to consider, depending on the sign of the numerator of the last term:
         1.	 b2 > 2k)"h: The nunleraror is negarive, so to minimize C(q) we want q as small
             as possible. But we musr srop ar q ~ blh with v = O. Thus, v* = 0, and so q* is
             just the EOQ formula. [More precisely, one can show that any solution (v, q)
             with v < 0 has cost at least C(q) > C(blh) > c).. + (2k1..h)1I2.]
                 2
         2.	 b '" 2k)"h: Here, we want q to be large. But there is no upper limit, so the
            model seems to prescribe q* = 00, which is meaningless. What is going on? In
            this case, b < C(q) for any q. The average cost of never ordering (b) is less
            than the cost of any other policy, so it is optimal never to order.

                The order cost is now k + c(q) ~ k + c(q' + v'). Suppose we incur the penalty b for
           each lost sale. (Equivalently, b is the unit cost for the emergency supply source.) Then,
           the total average cost is

           This has exactly the same form as the model in the prior subsection, assuming backorders
           but using A to measure service. Consequently, the solution is also the same: Either never
           lose sales, or abandon the business. (Problem 3.13 asks you to work out the details.)


3.4 A Finite Production Rate
           3.4.1 The Setting
           Return to the stipulation that all demand be filled immediately from stock.
                Recall, the supply process in the EOQ model can model a production process. The
           leadtime L is required to get the process going, but after that, production of a batch is in­
           stantaneous. Now. suppose instead that the process produces a continuous stream of out­
           put at a finite rate until the batch is complete. The process then shuts down until the next
           batch begins. Assume for now that, once production begins, the output becomes avail­
           able immediately to satisfy demand. (Section 3.4.5 below discusses the opposite case,
           where none of the output can be used until the entire batch is complete.)
                Define
                                  fL = production rate (quantity-units/time-units)
           When the processor is on, it must produce at rate fL, no less; the output rate is inflexible.
           Assume that fL > A. Otherwise, if A > fL, we can never hope to catch up with demand,
           even by producing continuously. We even disallow A = fL. (In that case, once production
           starts, we can meet all demand by producing continuously; supply and demand arc per­
           fectly matched! Alas, for some reason, this is impossible.) The utilization of the process
           is p = A/fL < 1, the fraction of time it spends actually producing.


           3.4.2 Performance Criteria
           Assume a constant batch size, q. Production begins precisely when the inventory hits
           zero. The inventory position can be used to implement this policy, as in the EOQ model:
           When IP(t-) = r = D, issue a production order for the amount q.
                Figure 3.4.1 illustrates the dynamics of the system. A cycle now means the time be­
           tween successive production starts. Each cycle consists of an active period when pro­
           duction occurs and an idle period following production. The full cycle time is again u ~
           q/A, so OF = A/q. The active period yields total output q at rate fL, so its length is q/fL =
           pu. The idle period is the remainder (I - p)u of the cycle.
                At the end of the active period, the output inventory reaches its maximum value of

                       q - (demand during the active period)     ~ q - A(~) ~ (1- p)q

     EXAMPLE 3.4.A, PART 1

     Consider an English soft-drink bottler. It measures physical quantities in thousands of cases, time
     in days, and money in £. By an amazing coincidence, the data in these units are exactly the same
     as in the paper supply problem above, i.e., A = 8, k = 130, and h = 1.173. The bottler's process­
     ing rate is !-L = 10, so p = 0.8. So,

                                   *~ [    2(130)(8) ]112 = 94
                               q          (1.173)(0.2)

                                  q*
                               u*=-=12
                                      l­

                              e" ~ 200        + [2(130)(8)(1.173)(0.2)]1/2 = 222
          The effects of changes in k and h on q* and C* are similar to those in the EOQ
     model. The optimal batch size and cost are robust with respect to such changes. The mag­
     nitudes ofthese effects, ofcourse, are influenced by the factor (I - p). Furthermore, for­
     mula (3.2.5) still applies; the cost is insensitive to suboptimal choices of q.
          Because of the limit imposed by fL, however, the demand rate A has very different
     effects. In the notation of Section 3.2.4,
                                               q*'     0' fl=P
                                              qo=VI:V~
     When A' > A, both factors on the right are greater than I. The first is the same as in the
     EOQ model; it reflects the relative change in demand. The second, however, depends on
     how close A and especially A' are to the limit fL. If A' is close to fL, this factor can be
     quite large. Thus, when the system nears full utilization (i.e., when p is near I), the op­
     timal order size is very sensitive to demand changes. Conversely, to take the optimistic
     view, under the same conditions a slight increase in the production rate f.L can substan­
     tially reduce q*.


     3.4.4 Setup Time
     Next, we introduce an additional element into the model: Prior to starting each produc­
     tion run, a positive setup time is required, during which no output is produced. Denote
                                          T   = setup time (time-units)

     You may have been thinking of the leadtime L as a setup time, but there is a crucial dif­
     ference: When the batch size q is small, there may be several orders outstanding at any
     given moment; that is, severalleadtimes may overlap. Furthennore, a production run can
     begin during the leadtime of a later batch. In short, the leadtime L does not tie up the pro­
     duction facility. During a setup, in contrast, there can be no output, and certainly setups
     cannot overlap.
          This distinction is sometimes expressed as the difference between internal and ex­
     ternal setups. An internal setup is one that ties up the production facility; this is what we
     call a "setup." An external setup can take place while the facility is doing other work; in
     our terms an external setup is part of the leadtime. Sometimes it is possible in practice

bottler's process­         For example, body parts for automobiles are made from sheet metal by a stamping
                     machine. To make one particular part, say a right fender, one must install a mold or die
                     for that part on the stamping machine. This die must be hot to work properly. Tradition­
                     ally, dies were heated after being installed. This was an internal setup. Toyota invented a
                     method ofheating dies before installation, thus converting this step to an external setup.
                           Intuitively, we expect a larger setup time to result in larger batches, for if we try to
                     make many small ones, the production facility will be constantly tied up performing
                     setups, leaving insufficient time for actual production. Indeed, the setup time imposes a
                     constraint on the batch size: The fraction oftime spent in actual production is p = A/f.L,
lSe in the EOQ       which we previously called the utilization. This is independent of q. The fraction oftime

lI'thermore, for­    T'A/q + p, and this quantity cannot exceed 1. That is, q must satisfy
f q.                                                                T'A

                          As long as this constraint is met, the setup time does not affect the inventory cost.
                     In effect, part of the idle time of each cycle is shifted to become the setup time in the
                     next cycle, so the graph of inventory over time is shifted to the right by T. Such a shift

                          1. Compute q* as in formula (3.4.2), ignoring the constraint.
                          2. Check whether q* satisfies (3.4.4).
                              a. If so, then q* is optimal.

     3.4.5 Demand-Ready Output in Whole Batches
     We have assumed until now that output immediately becomes available to meet demand.
     Therefore, we could wait until inventory dropped to zero before beginning production.
     In many cases, however, the finished product cannot be used until an entire batch is com­
     plete, perhaps because the batch must be moved to a warehouse, or because some fin­
     ishing operation or cooling is required.
          Here, we must start production when inventory is just sufficient to meet the demand
     during the production run itself The length of a run is again q/fJ-, so demand in this pe­
     riod is A(q/j,L) = pq. This is now the minimum inventory over a cycle. The maximum oc­
     curs when a batch is completed. At this point inventory must be sufficient to cover de­
     mand until the next batch is completed, that is, over an entire cycle. So, the maximum
     inventory is just q.
          Problem 3.14 asks you to show that the average inventory is simply the average of
     these maximum and minimum values, that is,                    ­

                                                 2
     Reasoning as above leads to
                                                     TA                2kA    }
                                     q* = max {(1 _ p) ,
                                                                    h(1+P)
     Assuming the setup-time constraint is not binding,
                                    C* ~ C(q*) ~ CA       + VC2k:-,,-ch(:-j-+---C

          Compare this formula with the optimal cost in the earlier case (3.4.2). You may have
     found it odd that previously the optimal cost was increasing in the production rate; ac­
     cording to that model, faster production eosts more! There, a slower production rate
     tends to smooth the inventory, while imposing no delays whatsoever in our capacity to
     meet demand. Such delays do occur in the current model, and additional stock is re­
     quired to cover them. As a result, the total cost is now decreasing in the production rate.
          This difference is no minor technical point. The basic production economics are to­
     tally different in the two cases. It is important to know whether an "improvement," like
     an increase in the production rate, will help or hurt cost performance!

     In this case, assuming a negligible setup time 'T, the bottler's optimal solution is

                               the additional amount over Xincurs the rate Cll where Cl < Co. Thus, the total order cost

                         2. q~ < X < qf

                    so q~ is optimal. In case 3, by a parallel argument, qf is optimal. Only in case 2 is there
                    any doubt. In that case, calculate both Co(q~) and Cr(qf) to determine which one is

                        Problem 3.16 asks you to extend the analysis to several breakpoints and cost rates.

                    ble solutions are X itself and q~. In that case, compare C,(X) and Co(q~) and pick the
                    smallest. Again, a couple of EOQ-like calculations suffice to find the optimal policy.


                    3.5.4 Discussio1l
                    The overall effect of a quantity discount, compared to the case where the variable cost c =
ore strictly con­
                    Co is constant, can only be to increase order sizes. Depending on the other parameters, ei­
respective min-
                    ther there is no effect (q* = q ~), or the optimal order size is larger than it would have been
                    otherwise.
                         Why then do suppliers offer quantity discounts in practice? The supplier may
                    achieve economies of scale from large orders. Or, the supplier may hope to attract new
                    customers with the lower price and/or to induce existing customers to buy more. Re­
                    searchers have investigated these and other mechanisms to explain price breaks, but
                    there is no clear consensus so far on which are the primary reasons. In fact, it is not easy
                    to construct a plausible scenario where a quantity discount makes sense.
58         Foundations o/lm'enrOly Management


                My own experience suggests that, often, suppliers offer discounts more out of habit
           than reasoned analysis. ("It's stupid, but our customers are used to it," one told me.) It
           may be possible and mutually beneficial to negotiate a revised cost schedule without
           quantity discounts. The supplier and the customer might agree to a constant cost rate c,
           say some average of Co and Cj, leaving both parties better off. The model above can help
           guide such discussions. (See Problem 3.17 for an illustration.)



3.6 Imperfect Quality
           3.6.1 Where Do Defects Occur and When Are They Found?
           Up to this point, we have assumed that the goods received from the supply system are
           free from defects, and the product remains in perfect condition through final delivery to
           the customer. This section relaxes these assumptions, but only a bit: Now, defects do oc­
           CUT. However, there are only two quality levels; a unit is either perfect or useless. Also,
           all defects are entirely predictable.
                As we shall see, such defects do not complicate the analysis much. In most cases
           we can account for them by adjusting the model parameters, and the solution re­
           mains the same or changes only slightly. (In reality, of course, poor quality does
           complicate life, for both analysts and managers. The worst effects, however, arise
           because of unpredictable defects, or because the system includes other stochastic
           features, such as leadtimes or demands, which defects exacerbate. Chapter 7 illus­
           trates this point.)
                The first questions to ask about quality are, where do defects occur and when are
           they found? Even in a structurally simple system, defects can arise in several places. The
           supply process itself may generate them. Or, they may appear in the inventory itself, as
           in a product prone to spoilage. Also, regardless of where the defects occur, in some sit­
           uations they are discovered immediately, while in others they are detected only at some
           later stage. Even under the simple assumptions above, these distinctions do matter. It is
           a general maxim of quality control that immediate inspection is always better; see Juran
           [1988], for instance. Still, it is useful to consider other possibilities, in part just to eval­
           uate the benefits of earlier inspection. Also, in some cases immediate inspection is phys­
           ically impossible or very costly.
                There are additional important questions: Do we pay for defective units? If we are
           reimbursed by the supplier, when do those payments occur?
                The next two subsections consider defects in the supply process and nowhere else.
           Section 3.6.2 explores the basic EOQ model, while Section 3.6.3 extends the finite­
           production-rate model. Then, Section 3.6.4 examines a perishable product, which tends
           to spoil in inventory.

           3.6.2 The EOQ Setting
           Begin with the basic EOQ model of Section 3.2. Suppose now that each batch the sup­
           ply system sends contains a fixed fraction of defective product, independent olthe batch
           size. (Problem 3.18 considers an alternative scenario.) Denote

                            to the supplier. Also, we do not have to pay for them; we are reimbursed in1ll1ediately.
                            This system operates just as if the order size were ~ q. Therefore, it is easy to account
                            for defects: Analyze the EOQ model, assuming no defects, interpreting q as the
                            nondefective yield of each batch. When it comes time to implement the policy, order

                            So, 1(1) behaves just as in the EOQ model with no defects. Accordingly,
                            replace!l by !J/~, since the whole inventory incurs direct handling costs. Also,
                            divide C and ac by~, as in case 2. Thus, the entire holding cost h is inflated

60   Foundations ofInventory Management


            Consequently, q* is even smaller, and C* larger, than in case 2. Compared to their
            values in the EOQ model, the actual order size and the square-root tenn in C* are
            larger by 1/~. Delayed detection does cost money, due to the increase in!l.
            Case 4 (delayed detection, reimbursement). Finally, consider the same scenario
            as case 3, but assume that we are reimbursed for defects. Specifically, we pay
            for the full batch on receipt, including defects. Later, we are reimbursed for
            each defective unit as it is found. It turns out that the effects on h are precisely
            the same as in case 3, as if we had to pay for defects! (To show this requires the
            methods of Section 3.7 below; see Problem 3.29.) Consequently, q* and the
            square-rootterm of C* are also the same as in case 3. Reimbursement does
            help, of course, because the CA term remains uninflated.
          To summarize, all four cases reduce to the EOQ model with appropriately adjusted
     parameters. Those adjustments and their effects depend on the details of inspection and
     cost reimbursement. Except in case I, defects increase the overall cost, though not by
     much. So, improving quality brings real, albeit modest, economic benefits. (It is worth
     reemphasizing that the impacts ofbad quality are much worse in a stochastic system. The
     benefits of quality improvement are, accordingly, much greater.)


     3.6.3 Limited Capacity
     Next, consider the system of Section 3.4 with a finite production rate J..L. For the moment
     assume there is no setup time (T = 0). While we are actually producing, defective goods
     emerge from the production process at rate 0J-L, while nondefective goods are produced
     at the rate ~I-'.
          Assume the case 1 scenario; we detect defects immediately and do not have to pay
     lor them. (Problem 3.30 explores another case.) So, the production process belongs to
     another organization from which we purchase goods. This system works precisely like
     one with no defects but a reduced 1-', namely ~I-'. Thus. the ratio p now becomes p/~. The
     model can thus be analyzed as if there were no defects, but these parameter sbifts do
     change the optimal policy: If output becomes available to meet demand immediately,
     then q* increases, according to (3.4.2):

                                                       (2i)..
                                               q*~...;~p/~)
     Otherwise (as in Section 3.4.5). q* decreases:
                                                             2kll.
                                              q* =
                                                       h(l   +   P/   ~)

     (Again. q* indicates the yield of a production run, so the total run size is q*/~.)
          All this assumes that the effective production rate ~I-' remains larger than the de­
     mand rate lI.. If not, the problem becomes entirely infeasible. Thus, defects can bave
     the drastic effect oftransfonning an adequate production process into one that is un­
     able to meet demand.
          Now, suppose there is a positive setup time, 1'. Even if A < ~J-L, so the problem is still
     feasible, the optimal policy can change radically. The setup time imposes a lower limit
                   Chapter 3   One Item with a Constallt Demand Rate                                           61

                   can be catastrophic (think of food poisoning), it is quite common to find a limit on the

                   defective when this time limit is reached.

           this function, solve C'(u) = O. (C is smooth and convex, so this approach works.) TIris equa­

                 We can get a rough notion of the effects of spoilage by an approximation: For small 0,
           q* = [2k'\/0- + ac + oc)] 112 (The technique underlying this result is explained in Section
           3.7.3.) So, spoilage effectively adds an additional component to the holding cost, forcing q*
           to be smaller. Intuitively, we want to keep the inventory low to avoid substantial losses.


3.7 The Present-Value Criterion
           3.7. I Objectives and Holding Costs
           The objective of each model above is the total average cost per unit time. This seems
           plausible. But, does it truly reflect the economic impacts of alternative policies? A pol­
           icy affects the whole pattern of costs over time. Does the average cost really capture the
           significant differences in these cost patterns?
                This section attacks the issue of comparing cost patterns from a different perspec­
           tive. We define a new objective, called the present value or discounted cost, and use it to
           reformulate the EOQ model of Section 3.2. The average-cost EOQ model can be under­
           stood as an approximation to this new one.
                The present-value objective has several advantages. It represents the financing com­
           ponent of the holding cost in real, tangible terms. Financing charges arise from the time
           gaps between purchasing expenditures and sales revenues. To bridge such gaps, firms
           must borrow money and pay interest. A unit in inventory has been purchased but not
           sold, so we can think of it as "generating" interest costs at rate nc. This story underlies
           the average-cost fOffimlation, but it is only a rough heuristic. A box sitting in a ware­
           house does not really generate interest costs. The new approach includes financing costs
           as they actually occur.
                This approach is especially helpful, indeed essential, in analyzing complex models
           with intricate costs and revenues. See Problems 3.27 and 3.29, for example.


           3.7.2 Definition ofPresent Value
           To set the stage, let us sketch a bit of financial theory: Suppose we can invest money at
           a constant, continuously compounding interest rate n. An investment of I now (time 0)
           will be worth ecu at time t. For the investment to be worth I at time t, the initial invest­
           ment must be e -o.t. In general, a cash flow/at time t can be exchanged for a cash flow
           e -n:lnow. This latter quantity is the present value of the original cash flow. The opera­

                    larly, an obligation to pay fat time t is equivalent to a cost of e -a'[today. This quantity

                         These assumptions are rather special. In reality, for example, one cannot borrow and
                    invest at the same interest rate; the borrowing rate is higher. Still, the present-value cri­
                    terion does reflect the fact that a cost today is more burdensome than a cost tomorrow.
                    This is, I believe, a real advantage over the average-cost measure.

     Unfortunately, there is no formula for the solution of equation (3.7.1). Fortunately, it is
     easy to solve numerically with a computer. It is interesting that the parameters k, c, and
     A appear only in the ratio IdcA.


     3.7.4 Comparison ofAverage-Cost and Present-Value Models
     At first glance (3.7.1) appears totally unrelated to the original EOQ model. However,
     there is a close connection: Recalling the power series for eX, eX = L';=o.x:ln!,!(x) just
     omits the first two tenus:
                                                                n
                                                   "'" x
                                           f(x) ~ L"~ll
                                                       n.
     Now, suppose a and k/cA are both small, so the relevant values ofx ~ au in (3.7.1) are
     also small. In that range we can approximatefby the first term in the series,f(au) =
     If( au)2 Solving (3.7.1) with this approximation yields

                                            u* =      (2k

                                             q * = '-/---;;;;

     Identifying h with ac, this is precisely the EOQ formula'
           Plugging this uinta (3.7.1) makes the left-hand side more than the right-hand side
     (since this solution neglects positive terms in f). Also, the left-hand side is increasing in
     u. To solve the equation exactly, therefore, means reducing u. Thus, the true u* is always
     less than the EOQ model's. Likewise, the true q* is less than the EOQ formula.
          The average-cost EOQ model is far more widely applied than the model above. This
     is partly because the EOQ model was developed earlier, and an explicit formula is eas­
     ier to understand than an equation. Also, the average-cost objective is built on concrete,
     physical measures like the average inventory. The economic justification for the present­
     value model is stronger, however.
           How closely does the EOQ formula approximate the discounted-cost solution? We
     know it is close when a and k/CA are small, but what ifthey are not? Look at Figure 3.7.1.
     It shows u* for the discounted-cost and average-cost models, graphed against the ratio
     k/CA. The time-unit is years. Two different interest rates are used, 12lf% and 25% (a =
     0.125 and 0.25); values in this range are common in practice. As expected, the differ­
     ences between the two models are negligible when k/CA is small, becoming larger when
     k/CA is large. Also, the relative differences are greater for larger a.
          The differences are significant, however, only when ideA is so large that the optimal
     cycle times are huge. Even for 0:: = 0.25, the u* curves diverge noticeably only when u*

         The rest of this book includes various models based on one or the other objective.
     In some places Ce.g., Chapter 9), results for both criteria are presented. Others focus on
     just one, but mainly for the sake of brevity. In most cases it is possible to construct and
     analyze a model based on either criterion. And the two models usually yield similar re­
     sults for a small interest rate. In practice, the choice of objective is a matter of modeling
     art. These criteria each have their own advantages, as discussed above. The choice is
     yours.

                   Notes

                                      Much ofthe material in this chapter was developed in the early twentieth century, as out­
                                      lined in the Notes to Chapter 1. Since then, the literature has continued to accumulate.
                                      It is now vast and still growing. I know of no single source that surveys it all. Useful
                                      points of entry include Aggarwal [1974] and Lee and Nahmias [1993].
                                          Recent investigations of quantity discounts include Monahan [1984] and Weng
                                      [1995]. The material on imperfect quality in Section 3.6, straightforward as it is, is
                                      mostly original here. Alternative scenarios are explored by Porleus [1986b] and Lee and
                                      Rosenblatt [1987]. Nahmias [1982] reviews the literature on perishable products.
                                          The discussions of process improvement (e.g., setup reduction, quality improve­
                                      ment) are inspired, in spirit ifnot in detail, by Porleus [1985, 1986a, 1986b].




                   Problems

                   3.1	 In Section 3.2.1 we assume that ao order is placed at time I only if 1(1-) = 0 (the zero-inventory
                        property). This problem suggests why. For simplicity assume that L ~ 0 and 1(0-) = 10(0-) = 0, so
                        we must order at time O. Any policy can be described through an increasing sequence of order times
                         {I,: i 2: I} and a corresponding sequence {q,: i 2: l} of positive order sizes. Consider only feasible
                        policies, with 1(1) 2: 0, and those with finitely maoy order times I, in every finite interval.

               (This problem generalizes the EOQ model and several others in the text; in these cases x = q,
          and a = 13 = 1. Here is another application: The optimal average cost C* in the EOQ model is a
          simple function of the fixed cost k; setting x = k gives c* ~ bx~, where b = (2'Ah)l/2 and 13~ "­
          Now, suppose the current fixed cost is Xo, and there is a range of investments we can make to reduce

         selecting the amount to invest reduces to the problem above.)
     3.8 Throughout this chapter we have assumed that the product is infinitely divisible and demand occurs
         continuously. This problem demonstrates that the EOQ model, with a slight modification, also
         describes a discrete scenario.
              Suppose that demands occur at discrete points in time, spaced 1/'1.. apart, in units of size 1. We
         order batches of size q, a positive integer, so that each batch arrives at the latest feasible moment.
         Show that OF = Vq, 1 =~(q - I), and
                                                                    k'A       I

          Denote the first difference operator Il.C(q) = C(q + 1) - C(q). The optimal q ~ q* satisfies Il.C(q - I)
          < 0 -;; Il.C(q). (This is the analogue of C'(q) = 0 in the continuous setting.) Show that this condition is

          Let q~ indicate the EOQ fommla, the optimal q for continuous demand. Argue that, if q~ happens to be
          an integer, then q* = q~, and otherwise q* is obtained by rounding q~ to an integer, either up or down.
              The same idea works, clearly, when the demand size is some number Yother than 1. (Just

           redefine the quantity unit to recover unit demands.) Now, return to the continuous scenario, but

           suppose that the order interval u is constrained to be integral. Show how to compute u*, adapting

3.14 Consider the model of Section 3.4.5 with a finite production rate fL, where product becomes
     available to meet demand only after a whole batch is complete. Show that, to avoid running out of
     stock, we must begin production when I(t) = pq. Also, show that, when a batch is completed, I(t)
     = q. Draw a graph of I(t) versus t. Show that Y = ~(I + P)q.
3.15 In the model of Section 3.4 suppose the parameters are

                                 A   ~   90        fL   ~   150         k = 500                   h=8
     First, assume each unit produced can be used to meet demand immediately. Compute the optimal
     policy and the optimal cost. Second, repeat the analysis, assuming that only whole batches can be
     used to meet demand. Finally, for both cases, determine the effect of increasing the demand rate A
     from 90 to 120.
3.16 Consider the incremental quantity-discount model of Section 3.5.2. Instead of only one breakpoint,
     suppose now there are n breakpoints Xo < XI < ... < Xn-l and n + I cost rates Co > C 1 > ... >
     Cn. For 0 < i < n, the cost rate C j applies to those units between Xi-t and Xj in an order; the highest
     cost rate Co applies to amounts from 0 up to Xo.. and the lowest rate C n to amounts above Xn-t. Write
     down an expression for the average cost ceq), and describe how to compute the optimal policy.
3.17 In the incremental quantity-discount model of Section 3.5.2 (with one brea,""point) compute the
     optimal policy and cost for the following data:

                             A   ~   10,000             k   ~   200          Ol   ~   0.10         1l~8

                                              Co   = 80               Cj ~    60         Xo   ~    314
     Now, suppose the supplier approaches us with a proposal to set the variable cost C to 62, regardless
     of the order size. Determine whether this new arrangement is beneficial for us. Why might the
     supplier prefer it? (Hint: Compare the new optimal policy to the earlier one.)
3.18 The EOQ model with imperfect quality of Section 3.6.2 presumes a fixed defect rate. Suppose now
     that the defect-generation process depends on the order size. Each increment has its own defect
     rate o(x), and the total defect quantity in an order of size q is Ll(q) = f6 o(x) dx. Assume that o(x) is
     increasing in x. (Think of the supply system as a production process. As it works on an order, the
     system deteriorates, and its defect rate grows.) On the other hand, a defective unit is not entirely
     worthless; instead of scrapping it, we can and do fix it at cost cf' where 0 < cf < c. In effect, we
     receive the full amount q in each order, but we pay the extra cost c/!.(q).
         Write down ceq), the total average cost, and compute its derivative C(q). Argue that the
     equation C'(q) = 0 has a unique positive solution, q*' (Do not try to show that C is convex; it need
     not be. Instead, reduce the equation to an equivalent one with                          cl
                                                                           on the left-hand side and another
     function of q on the right-hand side. Assume that o(x) is differentiable, and show that the right­
     hand side is decreasing in q.) Show that q* is less than the value given by the EOQ formula.
3.19 Verify the expression (3.6.2) for Yin the perishable-product model. Hint: Integrate both sides of
     (3.6.1), and use the fact that Y ~ (l/u)f~ I(t) dt.
3.20 For the perishable-product model of Section 3.6.4 show that the average cost ceu) in (3.6.3) is
     increasing as a function of 0 for each fixed value of u. Then, argue that the optimal cost C* is
     increasing in o.
3.21 This problem generalizes the exponential-decay model of Section 3.6.4. Presuming a cycle begins
     at time 0, inventory deteriorates during the cycle at the rate o(t)I(t), where the decay rate o(t) is
     some specified function of time, no longer a constant. Set up a differential equation to describe the

     (So, in the limit, C*(k) grows linearly at rate I, while COCk) becomes essentially flat. Thus, the two
     functions behave quite differently fur large k.)
3.27 The present-value model of Section 3.7 forbids backorders, and revenue accrues at the constant
     rate ph.. Now, relax this restriction. Suppose we follow an order-quantityJreorder-point policy, as in
     Section 3.3, with -q < v < O. We receive revenue only when a demand increment is actually met.
     There is no direct backorder-penalty cost.
         Derive an expression for the total present value of profit, as a function of u and y. where
     y = viA. is the safety time. Differentiate this function to obtain two equations describing u' and y'.
     What can you say about these values, compared to the optimal policy in the average-cost case?
         (Section 3.7 observes that the usual inventory-holding cost consists of two parts, a physical
     handling cost and a financing cost. The present-value model represents the financing cost directly,
     through the discounting of order costs. We see here that there is a financing component in the
     hackorder-penalty cost too, to account for delayed receipt ofrevenues.)
3.28 Suppose there is a finite production rate fL, as in Section 3.4, and the variable production cost is
     incurred continuously at rate qL while production actually occurs. Analyze this system using the
     present-value criterion. (Assume there is no direct holding cost, and each unit produced is
     immediately available to meet demand.) Show that the total discounted cost is
                                                  k   + (cA./O'p)(1 - e-·P")
                                        cell) =            I - e ."

     Differentiate this function to show that u* solves the equation

                                    pf[(1 - p)O'u]     +  (1 - p)f[-pO'lI] = ~
                                                        pO'                  eA.
     wheref(x) = eX - x - I, as before. Use the approximationf(x) = ~X2 to obtain an approximate
     formula for u·. Compare this with the optimal policy of the average-cost model.
         How do the model and its solution change when the variable cost for a batch eq is paid in a
     lump sum at the moment the lot begins production? (This is so, for instance, when cq represents
     the cost of materials, all of which must be on hand when production begins.)
3.29 Consider case 4 of Section 3.6.2: The supply system generates defects which are discovered only at
     the moment of demand. We pay for the entire batch on receipt, but we are reimbursed for defective
     units as they are found. Fonnulate this model using the present-value criterion. Argue that it
     reduces to a model with no defects. variable cost cI~, and revenue rate p + dl. Conclude that, in
     the average-cost approximatIOn of this model, the appropriate holding cost is h = O'cI~, as if there
     were no reimbursement.
3.30 Consider the model of Section 3.6.3: There is a finite production rate iJ-, and a fraction B of the
     output is defective. We discover and discard the defective goods immediately as they are produced.
     Suppose, however, that we pay the variable production cost c for every unit produced, defective or
     not, as in case 2. (This is so, for instance, when a defective unit must be scrapped entirely.)
         Formulate the model using the present-value criterion. (Hint: Use the result of Problem 3.28 as
     a starting point.) Then, approximate the model to derive the appropriate parameters for the average­
     cost model.

          tion continues throughout Section 4.3 and Section 4.4. Numerical examples relate the re­
          sults back to the intuitive findings of Section 4.2.
               Section 4.5 introduces a smoothing model. This model represents diseconomies of
          scale, the opposite of economies of scale, where large orders incur substantial cost
          penalties. The major virtues of the model-and its primary faults-are certain funda­
          mental symmetries in its fonnulation. These symmetries are not very realistic, but they
          lead to wonderfully simple, interesting results.


4.2 Extreme Cases
          Consider a scenario like that ofthe EOQ model in all respects but one: The demand rate
          is now a function of time, say A(t). The cost factors remain constant. The general case of
          this model is quite difficult. There are a few special cases, however, whose solutions can
          be described in simple terms, at least approximately. Understanding these special cases
          will help build our intuition about the overall effects oftime-varying demands.


          4.2.1 Small Changes
          First, suppose the demand rate A(t) changes over time, but only a little; there is some
          overall average demand rate A, and A(t) deviates from A by only a few percent. (This con­
          dition is vague, of course, and we shall leave it so; we could specifY a precise range for
          A(t), but we won't. We are not aiming for precise conclusions here.)
               Since A(t) is almost constant, the EOQ model with constant demand rate A is almost
          correct. If we use a constant order quantity q, the EOQ's cost function CCq) measures the
          actual cost quite accurately. Alternatively, if we use a constant cycle time u, Cluj is a
          good approximation. There is no compelling reason to consider radically different poli­
          cies. In sum, EOQ model's optimal policy (q* or u*) should work well, and its optimal
          cost C* should accurately approximate the true optimal cost.
               In Section 3.2 we found that the EOQ model is robust with respect to demand-rate
          changes. That analysis concemedpersistent changes, changes over all time. Here, the de­
          viations are transient. If anything, we should expect the EOQ model to be more robust
          in this setting.


          4.2.2 Fast Changes
          The scenario above limits the demand fluctuations' amplitude. The next two cases re­
          strict theirfrequency.
                First, suppose A(t) fluctnates quickly aroWld an overall average A. Again, we define
          this condition loosely: For each t, let Mt) denote the average of 1.0 over a small interval
          near t. Call A(t) a fast-changing demand rate, if Mt) is nearly constant and equal to A.
          (For example, compute u* = [2/dAh]Jl2, as in (3.2.3), and take Mt) to be the average over
          [t, t + Xu*].) The fluctnations may be large, but they are so rapid, the averaging process
          damps them out.
                Figure 4.2.1 shows what happens. The demand-rate fluctuations cause only tiny rip­
          ples in D(t), and hence in I(t). Clearly, the EOQ model accurately measures the costs of al­
          ternative policies. Again, we can iguore the fluctnations and apply the EOQ model as is.

                   stipulate that 1..0 change only a little over the interval [I, I + u(t)], for all f. (Evidently,
                   this condition depends on the cost ratio kill.)

agmg process              Why should this heuristic work? Here is an intuitive argument: Consider a rime pe­
                   riod of intermediate length, covering several order cycles but no large shifts in 1..(1) and
 only tiny rip­    q( I). lrA(l) really were constant, the EOQ model's optimal g* would nearly minimize the
he costs of al­    average cost over this period. Actually, A(t) does change, but only slightly, and each g(l)
'model as is.      is near q*. So, the heuristic policy nearly minimizes the average cost over the period.
76    Foundation.~   afInventory Mmagemellt


      But, this is true [or all such periods. Thus, the policy nearly minimizes the overall aver­
     age cost.
          Of course, this is not a rigorous proof, and a good deal of work would be required
     to make it so. Nevertheless, the basic idea is clear: The demand rate will change signif­
     icantly only in the distant future, and we can ignore such changes in the current order I,;y­
     cleo (This is a myopic heuristic, one that focuses on the near future only. Such methods
     are effective in a variety of situations. We shall encounter them again later.)
          The same reasoning suggests an approximation C* ofthe optimal average cost: Fol­
     lowing (3.2.4), define
                                      C*(t)   = C),(I) + Y2k),(I)h                         (4.2.2)


                                      C*      = limT-->oo(~)fb C*(I) dl
     (Think of C*(I) as the approximate instantaneous cost rate. The integral can be evaluated
     exactly, of course, only for certain special forms of),(I).)
          This model inherits the robustness properties of the EOQ model. For instance, '1(1)
     and C* change only slightly in response to a modest change in Ie, and if the entire func­
     tion ),(1) doubles. each '1(t) increases only by    \12,
                                                         as does C*. Moreover, '1(1) is dynami­
     cally robust as well. That is, consider one fixed function ),(1). If),(I) changes modestly
     over some interval of time, then q(t) changes even less over that interval.
          For this reason, an even cruder heuristic works fairly weB: Keep the order size (or
     the cycle time) constant most ofthe time. Change it only when q(l) (or U(I», as compnted
     above, departs too far from the current policy. It is often easier to administer a policy
     whose variables change infrequently.


     4.2.4 Discussion
     To summarize: [fthe changes in A(t) are small and/or rapid, focus on the long-rnn av­
     erage)" ignoring the current demand rate. If ),(1) evolves slowly, focus on the current
     ),(1), and ignore longer-run changes. The numerical examples of Section 4.3.5 snpport
     these suggestions.
           We can even combine these three cases: Suppose A(t) is the sum of three functions,
     a small-, a fast-, and a slow-changing one. Thal is, suppose the local average li(f) does
     change overtime, but only slowly. Following the arguments above, a reasonable heuris­
     tic policy is to set q(l) according to (4.2.1), using Mi) instead of ),(1).
           This is still a rather extreme case. What about more typical cases, where A(t) in­
     cludes changes of substantial size that are neither slow nor fast, but somewhere in be­
     tween? The following crude guideline appears to work well: Suppose ),(1) varies within
     a certain range. Compute the corresponding range of values for the EOQ formula. and
     set each order quantity within this range.
           Of course, when the range of ),(1) is wide, this guideline leaves a great deal of lee­
     way. As dIscussed below, there seem to be no more precise, simple, reliable guidelines
     for finding a truly optimal or even close-to-optimal policy. Algorithmic methods; exact
     or approximate, appear to be essential.

                The broad effect of these extended production cycles on performance is clear: The
          early part of each cycle builds up inventory in order to meet demand in the later part
          when demand is heaviest. Thus, we end up holding larger inventories than we would oth­
          erwise. (This effect can be quantified; see Problem 4.2.)
                The same ideas cover situations where the production rate also changes over time,
          i.e., '" ~ ",(t). One special case deserves mention, where ",(t) is proportional to A(t), so
          p(t) = A(t)/",(t) is the constant p < 1. Here, capacity expands and contracts in direct re­
          sponse to demand variations. Equation (4.2.3) reduces to

          As in the uncapacitated model, q(t) varies as the square root of A(t).

4.3 The Dynamic Economic Lotsize Model
          4.3.1 Discrete-Time Formulation

          and the purchase cost can vary over time in any manner. To attain this level of general­
                                                                                                               ..-

                    ity, we introduce a very different conception of time. We model time as a finite sequence
                    of discrete time points. We casually refer to time periods, the intervals between the time
                    points, but in this view of the world all the significant events occur precisely at the time
                    points themselves.
                        There are situations where discrete time describes reality better than continuous
                    time. For instance, it may well be that, by prior arrangement, we can order only at cer­
                    tain times, say once per week on Mondays at 9:00 A.M. Alternatively, a discrete-time
                    model can be employed to approximate a continuous-time system. (As in any such dis­
                    cretization, of course, the approximation is more accurate when the time points are close
                    together.) We may think of the time periods as being of equal length, though this is not
                    necessary. In fact, it is sometimes better to use short periods near the beginning and
                    longer ones toward the horizon.
                        The world of discrete time takes some getting used to; the terminology, notation,
                    and overall style are rather different from anything we have seen before. Indeed, the con­
"
                  nection to continuous-time models may not be immediately apparent. Rest assured, the
                    connection exists, as explained later.
                         The problem, in words, is the following: Demand for a product occurs at each of
                    several time points. We must meet all demand as it occurs; no backorders or lost sales
                    are pennitted. We can order or produce supplies at each point, and we can carry inven­
                    tory from one point to the next. Replenishment decisions take effect inuuediately; there
                    is no order leadtime. Each order incurs a fixed cost regardless of the size of the order,
                    and also a variable cost proportional to the order quantity. There is a cost to hold inven­
                    tory between any two successive points. These costs as well as the demands may change
                    over time. The goal is to detennine a feasible ordering plan which minimizes the total
                    cost over all time points.

                    chunks, not continuously. Also, we use z(1) for the order size, not q(I). We reserve q(l) to de­
                    scribe a policy, indicating the amount to order if certain conditions are met, whereas z(1)
                    specifies precisely what to order with no conditions attached. This is the most common us­
                    age in the literature on discrete-tmoe models, perhaps because z(l) looks more like a deci­
:Ie the demand      sion variable than q(I). For similar reasons we denote inventory by x(l) instead of 1(1). (In
,-el of general­    Section 4.4, X(I) will have the more general meaning of net inventory or inventory position.)

          The precise sequence of events at each time point t < T is as follows:

          1. We observe the inventory x(I).
          2. We decide the order size z(I).
     Then, sometime during period I, the order z(l) arrives and the demand d(l) occurs. We
     don't care precisely when these events happen, provided they are complete by the end of
     the period, in time to determine x(t + 1) at point I + 1. The story concludes at step 1 of
     the last time point T; the tenninal inventory x(I) is important, but there is no order or de·
     mand at the horizon.

          The cost parameters are the following:


         k{1)   ~   fixed order cost at time I
         C(I)   ~   variable order cost at time I
         h(t)   ~   inventory holding cost at time I.
     These are all nonnegative. Let 0(-) denote the Heaviside funclion, that is, o(z) = 1 for
     z> 0, and o(z)  ~ 0 for z,,; O. The total order cost at time I is thus k{1)o(z(I)) + c(I)=(I).
     The holding cost at I is h(l)x(I). We ignore the constant cost h(O)x(O) = h(O)xo, but we
     do include the terminal holding cost h(7)x(I).
         We are now prepared to fannulate the model:

     Initial conditions:
                                                         x(O) = Xo                             (4.3.1)
     Dynamics:

     This optimization problem is called the dynamic economic lolsize (DEL) model. It is
     also called the Wagner· Whilin problem after its inventors, Wagner and Whitin [1958]. (It
     is a special instance of a general modeling framework for discrete-time dynamical sys­
     lems and optimal conlrol. In those terms, X(I) describes the slale ofthe system, z(l) is the
     conlrol variable. and d(l) is the exogenous inpul. See Appendix B. The dynamics (4.3.2)
     express a conservation-of-flow law for this system.)
         There are alternative scenarios, where time is less strictly discrete, which lead to the
     same mathematical model. For instance, as explained in Section 4.4.3, holding costs can
     accrue continuously throughout the period. The crucial assumption is the restriction of
     order decisions to the discrete time points.
         Here is some additional notation, used below:

                     Thus, the DEL model can be expressed as a linear mixed-integer program. (This refor­
                     mulation is interesting; the same trick can be applied to more complex systems, as in
                     Chapter 5. But it is not immediately practical, for integer programs are hard to solve.)


          (4.3.1)    4.3.2 The Linear-Cost Case
                     The linear-cost case, where all the k(1) ~ 0, is easy to solve, and the solution is interesting.
          (4.3.2)          First, suppose that all the c(l) equal some constant c 2': O. The solution is obvious:
                     Assuming X o ~ 0, set each z(l) ~ d(l) and x(l) ~ O. Likewise, if X o > 0, order nothing
                     until the initial stock runs out, and fi·om then on order the minimal amount required to
          (4.3.3)    keep x(l) 2': O. In general, order as little and as late as possible, while still meeting de­
                     mand as it occurs. This is the discrete-time version of a perfect flow system-it meets
                     all demands while holding no inventory (except any remaining from the initial stock).
                           Now, suppose the variable costs c(t) do depend on I. The basic economic issue here
         (4.3.4)     is the balance of purchase and holding costs: We can avoid projected cost increases by
                     ordering earlier than necessary, but then we incur holding costs.

                     rately for each t. These optimal order times are independent of the demand quantities
                     d(t); they depend solely on the cost factors.

           The following recursive scheme streamlines the calculation:
                            c[*, 0)   ~   c(O)                                                (4.3.7)

                            c[*, I + 1)    ~     min{c[*, t) + h(t + 1), c(1 + I))
       That is, there are only two possible values for s(1 + 1): If the first quantity in brackets is
       smaller, then s(1 + 1) ~ set), while ifthe second is smaller, then s(1 + 1) ~ 1+ 1. (Prob­
       lem 4.3 asks you to validate this approach.) For each I > 0, (4.3.7) requires the smaller
       of two numbers instead of the I + 1 in (4.3.6). Also, in (4.3.7) there is no need to com­
      pute the c[s, t) in advance. If we do order at some time 5, we order enough to meet de­
       mand at several conseculive time points (those I 2: S for which s(l) ~ s). (This latter prop­
       erty holds for positive k(1) too, as we shall see shortly.)
            When Xo > 0, calculate the set) as above. Not all of these times represent actual or­
       ders, however. Use the initial inventory to meet demands until it runs out, thus replacing
      some ofthe earliest orders.
           Incidentally, when s(l) < I, we say there is a speculative motive for holding inven­
     tory, for this means we anticipate an increase in the purchase cost from period set) to t,
     large enough to offset the intervening holding costs. If on the other hand set) = t for all
     t, as in the case of constant e(l), we say the problem offers no speculation opportunities.
     This latter case is important, even when there are additional complexities like fixed
     costs.


     4.3.3 The Zero-Inventory Property
     The general DEL model with positive k(1), as formulated above, is a hard-to-solve non­
     linear program or an equally hard linear mixed-integer program. The model possesses a
     remarkable property, however, which we shall exploit later to devise a simple solution
     procedure.
          Given a feasible solution, caU I an order lime if z(l) > O. The central result describes
     the optimal schedule in terms ofthe optimal order times, and is called the zero-inventory
     property. It is simplest to state assuming Xo = 0: Orders should be planned so as to run
     out of stock just as each order is received. This rule works in the general case Xo =::: 0 too,
     with a slight qualification: The first order may arrive when there is positive inventory,
     but only the first. Here is a formal statement:
     THEOREM 4.3.1. There exists an optimal solutionx*(I), z*(I) to equations (4.3.1) to
     (4.3.4) such that z*(I) > 0 only when x*(I) ~ 0, for every I except possibly the earliest
     order time.
     Recall, we assumed essentially the same property for the EOQ model in Section 3.2 (and
     verified it in Problem 3.1). The theorem asserts that this property continues to hold even
     with nonstationary data.
          The zero-inventory property implies that, at each order time, we order precisely the
     amount needed to cover demand until the next order time. In particular, the order times
     completely determine the order quantities. This point is crucial for the reformulation of
     the next subsection. (Also, assuming Xo = 0, when the d(t) are all integers, so are the

          (4.3.7)    matically. This is even true, it turns out, when Xo is positive but integral.)

mdx(s + I) ~           compute the minimum-cost path from node 0 to every node I, starting with I = I, then
                       I ~ 2, and continuing until I = T. This method solves the DEL model with horizon I for
                       each I. Let V"(I) denote the optimal cost of the I-horizon problem, so V'(T) is the opti­

                    For the example above, the solution is

                    The solution tells us to plan two orders: Order 12 units at the beginning to eover the demands at
                    points 0 and 1, and then order 30 at point 2 to cover the remaining demands. The total optima) cost
                    is 1"(5) ~ 198.
                         Incideutally. there is another approach to the problem called bacbvard recursion:
                    Take Figure 4.3.1, tum it upside down, reverse all the arrows, and apply Algorithm
                    Forward_DEL to this network. In terms of the original problem, tills method works in
                    the opposite direction, finding the optimal path jrom each I to T The cost of that path,
                    say V'( I), measures the optimal cost over times I through T starting with X(I) = O. The
                    optimal cost of the full DEL model is V'(O) = V'(I).
                         This method is essentially equivalent to Algorithm Forward_DEL, but it is worth
                    knowing about anyway: People do use it. It recovers not just a solution but a full optimal
                    policy. Letting q(l) be the first order in the I-to- T subproblem, q(l) prescribes the amount
                    to order at time I, ifx(l) ~ 0, as in § 4.2.3. Finally, this approach is similar conceptually
                    to that of Chapter 9 for stochastic models; both are sometimes called dynamic program­
                    ming approaches.
                         How much effort does Algorithm Forward_DEL require? There are Titerations, and
                    the tth entails t similar calculations. The total number of calculations is thus proportional
                    to I, t ~ 'hT(T + I). The quadratic term is the dominant one for large T So, we say the
                    algorithm requires 0(T 2 ) time. (This uotation has a precise meaning, but this infOlmal
                    Chapin 4   Time-Varying Demands                                                           87

                    definition will do here. Setting up the k[s, I) also requires 0(T 2 ) time.) This summarizes
                    the capability of the algorithm to handle large problems: As T increases, the time re­
                    quired grows roughly as T 2
                         Quadratic growth is not bad as these things go; other algorithms for other problems
                    are far more sensitive to their primary size parameters. (See Section 4.4.5, for instance.)
                    Even so, researchers have recently developed refmed procedures requiring only O[(T) log
                    (T)] time in general, and only O(T) for problems with no speculation opportunities. These
                    methods are thus faster than Algorithm Forward_DEL for large T (Federgruen and Tzur
                    [1991] report that theirs runs about 3 times faster for T = 500 and 70 times faster for
g the s'(t) back    T = 5000. Such huge T's can arise, for instance, in a discretization of an originally con­
IIld so on.         tinuous model.) They require some additional computational overhead, however, and for
                    small Tthey are a bit slower.
                         The basic idea is simple: To determine s'(I), Algorithm Forward_DEL searches over
                    all s < t. Even for large t, it continues to consider even the smallest s's. The new algo­
                    rithms extract information from prior iterations to help guide the search, specifically, to
                    eliminate some of the s's. [The same idea underlies the streamlined recursion (4.3.7) for
                    the linear-cost case. See also Problem 4.5a.]
                         The asymptotic growth rates expressed in the 0(-) notation do not tell the whole
                    story. If an algorithm took 3 years to solve a problem with T ~ I, it would be little com­
                    fort to know that a problem with T ~ 100 requires "only" 3(1002 ) or even 3(100) years!
                         The DEL model, fortunately, has no such problem. The individual calculations in
                    Algorithm Forward_DEL are ve,y simple. The newer methods are nearly as simple. Pro­
                    vided some care is given to efficient programming, most practical-sized problems can
                    be solved quickly. For example, with T = 26 (half a year ofweekly time periods), the en­
                    tire calculation requires a fraction of a second on any decent personal computer.
                         One additional fact deserves mention: In some instances of the DEL model, it is
rthe demands at
                    possible to identify (see PlOblem 4.5b) a planning horizon. This is a time point, say IH ,

                    which essentially separates earlier times from later ones. Specifically, for s < tH -- 1, the

     the demand rate remains constant at the current value d( I). Finally, the vertical lines in­
     dicate the optimal orders in the DEL model.
          It is striking how closely the positive z*(I) track the q(I). The spacing of the lines,
     moreover, indicates that orders are more- frequent as well as larger when demand is large.
     (The EOQ model exhibits similar behavior.) The correspondence is not perfect, mainly
     because of the DEL model's discrete time. This example illustrates one of the special
     cases of Section 4.2: When demand changes slowly, the EOQ model using the current
     demand rate works well.
          Next, Figure 4.3.4 presents a model with fast-changing d(I). The positive z*(I) are
     all equal to 32. (The exact equality here is somewhat coincidental. For other values of k,
     for example, the z*(I) do change, though not much.) This common value is near the EOQ
     model's q* of28.3, based ou the average demand rate of 4. This example illustrates an­
     other extreme case of Section 4.2: Rapid fluctuations can essentially be ignored.
          Figure 4.3.5 shows a model with a highly irregular demand pattern. In this case the
     ranges of the orders generated by the DEL and EOQ models are about the same. It is
     hard to discern any precise correspondence between them. however. The fine structure
     of the optimal solution exploits the demand fluctuations in subtle ways.
          Most instances of the DEL model have similarly subtle solutions. In this sense, com­
     pared to the EOQ model with its siruple formulas, the DEL model is opaque. Except in the
     extreme cases of Section 4.2, it is hard to see why the algorithm makes the precise choices
     it does. In fact, a tiny change in the model parameters can cause the solution to shift
     markedly. We need a clever algorithm to find the optimal solution; no simple formula will

     do. On the other hand, the range of order sizes is usually within the range of values indi­
     cated by the myopic use of the EOQ model, as suggested in Section 4.2.4.
          This opacity rules out sensitivity analysis, or at least simple, transparent results like
     those in Chapter 3. There do exist some limited sensitivhy results; see Problems 4.6 and
     4.7 and Zangwill [1987], for instance.


     4.3.6 Heuristics
     Even though it is not hard to solve the DEL model exactly, several heuristic methods
     have been developed, for reasons explained below. We describe one popular approach,
     the Silver-Meal heuristic (Silver and Meal [1973]). Most of the others are similar in
     spirit. The idea is to look ahead only a few periods, not all the way to the horizon, to set
     each order quantity. (This is a common analytical tactic, sometimes called the greedy or
     myopic approach; we saw the idea in Section 4.2.) The heuristic itself determines how
     far ahead to look as it works.
           Assume Xo = O. Focus on the fIrst order, restricting attention to values consistent
     with the zero-inventory property. So, z(O) may cover just the initial demand d(O), or
     D[O, 2) ~ d(O) + d(l), or D[O, 3) ~ d(O) + del) + d(2), et cetera. [fit covers D[O, u),
     then the total cost over this interval is k(0, u), so the average cost is k[O, u)/u. The heuris­
     tic aims to make this average cost small: Starting with u = 1, it increments u by 1 as long
     as the average cost decreases; once it finds that a further increment would increase the
     average cost, it stops. This rule detennines z(O).
           If the heuristic stops at ll, setting z(O) = D[O, u), thenx(u) = 0.1t then restarts, treat­
     ing u as the initial period, and computes z(u) as above. It continues in this manner until
     it reaches the horizon.

     EXAMPLE 4.3.A, PART 3

     Reconsider the small example of § 4.3.4. To select z(O), the heuristic computes

                                             k[O, 1) ~ 60 ~ 60

                                               -3 - 3

     So, the heuristic sets z(O)   ~   D[O, 2)   ~   12. Next,

                         This negative result is based on a worst-case analysis, which, by design, focuses on
                    extreme cases. What about more "typical" cases? A good deal of research has been de­
                    voted to empirical performance testing, including Wemmerlov [1982], Blackburn and
                    Millen [1985], and Baker [1990,1993]. They find that the Silver-Meal heuristic and re­
                    lated methods perfoffil reasonably well over a wide range of problems, on average.
                         Why bother with a heuristic when the exact algorithms are so fast? Well, the heuristic
                    is even faster. It requires O(T) time, which certainly beats Algorithm Forward_DEL for
                    large T The newer algorithms also require O(T) time (for stationary costs). But, simple as
                    those algorithms are, the heuristic's internal mechanics are even simpler, so it is still faster.
                         This speed advantage was more important in 1973 when the heuristic was intro­
                    duced than it is now, for computers then were far slower and far less accessible, and the
                    newer algorithms were unknown. Today, in my view, the exact procedures are fast
                    enough for most practical purposes.
                         Apart from the speed issue, there are other reasons that follow to consider the
                    heuristic.


                    4.3.7 Modeling and Implementation Issues
                    The DEL model is widely used. (Often, it is part of a larger model with many products or
                    locations, as discussed in Sections 5.7 and 5.8 ofChapter 5.) In virtually every application,
                    the real situation differs considerably from the world envisioned by the model: The
92      Foundations afInventory Management


         demands are more-or-Iess imperfect forecasts, and the costs are rough estimates. Typically,
         the model is solved repeatedly over time with frequently updated data. (That is, the hori­
        zon length T is fixed, but the time interval [0, T] shifts ahead as time passes, so that "now"
         always means rime point 0.) This is called a rolling-horizon scenario.
              Such discrepancies between a model and reality are hardly unique here. Every ap­
         plied model functions within a far more complex world. This fact is cause for neither
         despair nor complacency. A good model is valuable partly because it focuses on sim­
         ple essentials, ignoring real-world complexities. On the other hand, a good modeler
         has to know both the world and the model, and to navigate the gaps betweeu them.
              In the context of the DEL model, these general COncerns include a variety of spe­
         cific modeling and implementation issues. Let us briefly discuss a couple of them:
              One issue is the choice of solution method As mentioned above, the optimal solu­
        tion is usually a few percent better than the Silver-Meal heuristic's, and occasionally
        much better. The question is, how meaningful is the difference in the real world? The
       heuristic is myopic, ignoring the distant future where the parameter forecasts are least
       certain. Does it therefore extract most of the useful infonnation in the data? The optimal
       solution cleverly exploits every opportunity embodied in the model parameters to mini­
       mize cost. But, when the parameters are only estimates, are these opportunities real or
       just fleeting mirages?
             It would be nice to have a clear-cut answer, but unfortunately there is none, not yet
      at"/east This: issue is a contentious one~ and tlIere is eVIdence to support botb SIdes,   SOflle
       of the empirical studies cited above simulate rolling-horizon scenarios, and in some of
      those the heuristics seem to work as well as optimization, or even better. On the other
      hand, it is easy to construct a plausible scenario where optimization clearly wins.
            The "right" answer, of course, depends a great deal on just how precise the param­
      eter estimates are. People disagree about this too. In my experience, real-world settings
      differ widely in this respect; in some cases the estimates are sharp, while in others they
      are crude. So, I sit squarely on the fence; I believe that optimization and heuristics both
      have their places.
            If the estimates are too noisy, the DEL model itself ceases to be useful, and no com­
      putational techniqne can save it. The primary issue becomes modeling, not method. One
      option is to expand the model to include imperfect forecasts explicitly. Such stochastic
      models are discussed in Chapter 9. Some are much more complex than the DEL model,
      but others are only little more. The philosophy there is to seek a robust policy, one that
      works well for a range of possible future outcomes, instead of the best schedule for one
      particular forecast.
           Another option is to adjust the DEL model by adding safety stock (sometimes called
      buffer stock). This means changing the lower bound on x(t) in the constraints from 0 to
     some positive value, say x_(t), for some or all t. This variant of the DEL model, it turns
     out, is no harder to solve than the original. (In fact, the new model is equivalent to an in­
     stance of the DEL model itself, as Problem 4.8 asks you to show.) It is no easy matter,
     however, to determine "good" values for the L(t). Most practical methods borrow
     guidelines from the analysis of stochastic models, like those of Chapter 9. Thus, the
     safety-stock approach tries to mimic a stochastic analysis within a detenninistic model.
           Another, related issue is nervousness. This refers to the fact, mentioned above, that
     the optimal solution of the DEL model can shift abruptly in response to small parame­

ates. Typically,                ter changes. In a rolling-horizon scenario, one solution can schedule a large order at
lat is, the hori­               some future time, and then a subsequent solution, based on updated parameters, can
oso that ''now''                move that entire order to a different time, or combine it with another, or split it into two.
                                     Well, so what? If the data change, the schedule should change, shouldn't it? The dif­
ere. Every ap­                  ficulty lies in how the model is used: The DEL model is often used to guide not just the

~uses   on sim­                 maintenance schedules. All these decisions, the orders themselves (as discussed in Sec­

     4.4.1 Leadtimes
     The DEL model has no explicit order leadtime, but it is easy to include one. Let L de­
     note the leadtime, a fixed, positive integer. An order placed at time I arrives at the end of
     period t + L - 1, in time to be counted in the inventory at time t + 1. (By this conven­
     tion, the original DEL model has leadtime I, not 0.)
           Just change the meanings ofthe variables and cost factors: Now, =(I) means the quan­
     tity ordered at time I - L + I, and k{1) and C(I) describe the costs incurred by this order.
     Tbisz(l) still arrives just before time I + I, so the dynamics (4.3.2) are still valid. Tbe ini­
     tial conditions require a slight adjustment. The z(l) for I < L - I and the x(l) for I < L have
     been determined already before time I = 0; they become fixed constants. Thus, as in the
     EOQ model, we can account for the leadtime by keeping careful track of the calendar.
           There is another, equivalent way to revise the formulation, focusing on physical
     stock instead of time: Return =(t) to its original meaning, the order placed at time I, but
     redefine x(l) as the inventon' position at step (I) of time t, and Xo as the initial inventory
     position. Also, use the symbol.i(l) for the actual inventory at time I. Clearly, these vari­
     ables are related by the identity
                                        x(1   + L)   = x(t) -   D[t, I + L).
     This is the discrete-time analogue of (3 .2.1). With these definitions the initial conditions
     (4.3.1) and the dynamics (4.3.2) remain valid as stated, but x(t) replaces x(t) in the con­
     straints (4.3.3) and the objective (4.3.4).
          Now, use the equations above to eliminate~e xC!). The end result is another instance
     of the DEL model. [The lower bound onx(t) i (4.3.3) is now D[t, I + L) > 0 instead of
     zero, but that difference is inessential, as Pro lern 4.8 demonstrates. This lower bound
     serves as a reorder point. Also, the objective h s an additional constant term.]
          The time-based approach above is simpler, ut this stock-based approach is worth
     knowing too. We shall use similar transformations in the stochastic-demand models of
     Chapter 9.


     4.4.2 Discoullted Costs

     The objective ofthe DEL model is the total cost from now until the horizon. This is equiv­
     alent, of course, to the average cost over that time. It is easy to adjust the DEL model to
     represent the discrete-time analogue of the discounted-cost criterion of Section 3.7.
           How do the present-value calculations work in a discrete-time context? For the mo­
     ment, suppose that time is really continuous, and the length of each of our periods is ex­
     actly 1, so the time index t correctly measures time on the continuous scale. Letting ex.
     denote the interest rate. the present value of a unit cash flow at time t is e -ut, as before.
     Equivalently, defining 'I ~ e -u, the present value is 'I'. If the period length is different
     from 1, say w, redefine 'Y = e -UW, so that the present value of a unit cash flow at time
     point t is again 'Y t . The fraction 'Y is called the discount/actor.
          Now, suppose that time is really discrete. The story in Section 3.7 can be retold en­
     tirely in discrete-time terms. Here, a is the one-period interest rate (regardless ofthe pe­
     riod length), and-y = lit I + a). The conclusion is the same: The present value of a unit
     cash flow at time point t is 'Y I .

                          Turning to the DEL model, suppose e(t), k(t), and h(l) are the actual cost factors. To

                    Now, suppose that backorders are allowed, as in Section 3.3 of Chapter 3. Redefine the
1 be  retold en­    state variable x(t) to mean the net inventory (inventory minus backorders). The initial con­
le:ss of the pe­    ditions (4.3.1) and the dynamics (4.3.2) remain valid as stated. Omit the constraints

96   Foundations o/Inventory Management


            Incidentally, a standard formulation trick recovers a linear objective (apart from the
     o(z) terms): Define two new variables for each t, the inventory x +(t) and the backorders
     x - (t). Replace x(t) in the dynamics by the difference x +(t) - X -(t) and C(t, xU)) in the
     objective by h(t)x+(t) + b(t)x-(t), and add the constraints x +(t) 2: 0 and x -(t) 2: O. (For
     this to work x + (t) and x - (t) cannot both be positive. The constraints do not enforce this
     condition, but the objective ensures that it holds anyway.)
            In the original DEL model, the zero-mventory property implies that each order
     covers the entire demand over several consecutive time points. It turns out (see Problem
     4.10) that this is true also in the model with backorders. In the original model, however,
     the interval covered by an order always begins with the order time itself, whereas here it
     may begm earlier. That is, each order (except perhaps the first) covers the demand at its
     own time, plus some earlier and later times.
            Thus, the overall behavior of the net inventory is much the same as in the continUQllS­
     time, constant-demand model of Section 3.3. It decreases at most times, increasing only at
     order times. Typically, an order raises x( t) from a negative to a positive value. So, a solu­
     tion divides time into cycles, each consisting of a part with inventory followed by a part
     with backorders. (Because time is discrete, however, the inventory or backorder part can
     disappear. )
            Using this property, one can construct a network whose paths correspond to poten­
     tial solutions of the problem, as in Section 4.3.4. There is one node for t ~ T, labeled T-,
     but two nodes for each t < T, indicated by (- and t+ . The arcs eonnect pluses to minuses
     and minuses to pluses. Specifically, there is an arc (t-, u+) for all t ::; u and an arc
     (t+, u-) for all t < u. See Fig. 4.4.1. A path from 0- to T - corresponds to a solution as
     follows: Tbe nodes t+ encountered along the path describe the order times, while the
     nodes t- specify the amounts ordered: Ifthe path contajns the arcs (s-, t+) and (t+, u-)
     for s :.s t < u, the order at time t covers the demands ~t time points s through u - 1.
            It is possible to assign a cost to each are, as in ~.3 .8), so that the total cost of a so­
     lution equals the sum ofthe arc costs on the corresp ding path. (Problem 4.11 asks you
     to supply the details.) Thus, as in the DEL model, to compute the optimal solution, just
     detennine the minimum-cost path in the network.

                     x>(t) is the discrete-time analogue ofan interval [L, t ], in the notation ofSection4.2.5.
                          Interestingly, it is possible to use these quantitie to derive an equivalent model in
                     which demand never exceeds capacity. The demands r this new model are d(t) ~ d(t)
                     + x>(t + 1) - x>(t), and the initial inventory is Xo = Xo - x>(o); the cost factors are
                     just the original ones. (See Problem 4.13.) Even in this revised formulation, however, we
                     cannot ignore the capacity constraints.

~                          The analogue of the zero-inventory property here is fairly subtle: Every feasible so­
                     lution divides the periods into what we call inventory cycles. An inventory cycle consists
                     of successive periods s, with t ::; s < u say, starting with x(t) = 0 but with positive in­
                     ventory at all other times s. (Since u begins the next cycle, we also have x(u) ~ 0.) There
                     is some optimal solution whose inventory cycles each have the following property: For
                     every time S except at most one, we produce nothing or at full capacity, i.e., z(s) equals
                     o or z+(s).
                          Unfortunately, this property, while interesting, does not always lead to a tractable al­
                     gorithm. The general version of the problem is very hard. (In technical terms it is NP-hard;
                     the time required by every known algorithm grows exponentially in the problem size.)
98   Foundations afInventory Management


           In certain special hut important cases. however, it is possible to solve the problem with
     relative ease. In the linear-cost case, the problem is a linear program. (This linear program
     has a useful special structure-it can be recast as a minimum-cost network-flow problem,
     and this in turn can be expressed as a transportation problem. See Problem 4.14. There are
     very fast specialized algorithms to solve such problems; see Chvatal [1983], for example.)
           Also, consider the case with positive fixed costs hut equal capacities z+(t) = z+.
     Here, the inventory-cycle property can be exploited to devise a reasonably tractable al­
     gorithm. Here is the basic idea: Focus on any potential inventory cycle, specified by the
     pair (I, u). The inventory-cycle property implies that the cumulative production at each
     time s can take on only a small number of values. Using this fact, one can compute the
     optimal solution within the cycle, assuming X(I) = x(u) = O. (See Problem 4.15.) Call
     the cost of this solution k[l, u). Now, use these costs within Algorithm Forward_DEL.
     This procedure dctennines the optimal set of inventory cycles, hence the optimal over­
     all solution. The calculation of the k[l, u) is more involved than in the DEL model, and
     the overall algorithm runs in O(T 4 ) time.
           The capacitated DEL model is an important one, but it is not a perfect model of a
     production process: If there are orders in several consecutive periods, every one incurs
     a fixed cost. A typical production system, however, incurs a setup cost only at the be­
     ginning of a production run. If the time periods are short, and we expect a production
     run to cover many of them, then the capacitated DEL model presents a distorted picture
     of production-setup costs.
           Here is an alternative fonnulation: Say that t hegins aproduction run if z(t) > 0 and
     either I ~ 0 or z(t - I) < z+(t - I). The setup cost k(1) is incurred at such time points
     and only those. If z(t) > 0 but z(1 - I) = Z+(I - I). an earlier production run continues
     through I, so z(l) incurs no setup cost.
           In certain cases, this model is easier to solve than the capacitated DEL model. Sup­
     pose there are no speculation opportunities (S(I) = I), and de,) -<; z+(t) (following the
     transfoffilation above, if necessary). One can show that every production run begins with
     zero inventory, except perhaps the first. Let k[l, lI) be the cost of beginning a production
     run at I and producing a total ofD[I, lI) to meet demand through fell - 1. (This is easy
     to compute.) Using these costs within Algorithm Forward_DE solves the problem.
           An even simpler model is the all-or-nolhing formulatio : Each z(l) can take only
     two possible values, 0 or Z+(I). (Thus, z(l) ~ z+(t)v(I), so the ariables z(t) can be elim­
     inated.) This is the discrete-time analogue of the finite-capa ity EOQ model of Sec­
     tion 3.4 and Section 4.2.5. Here, every solution corresponds to a path in a network sim­
     ilar to Figure 4.4.1. (Node t+ mdicates a possible beginning of a production run, and
     node 1- an end.) Thus, a shortest-path calculation determines the optimal solution.


     4.4.6 Quantity Discounts
     Now, suppose the supplier offers an incremental quantity discount, as in Section 3.5.2 of
     Chapter 3. Let e(l, z) denote the variable cost of placing an order for z units at time I. In
     the original DEL model e(l, z) is linear in z for each I, but now it is piecewise linear. (It
     has the sarne form as the function e(q) in Section 3.5.) So, replace each term e(I)z(I) in
     the objective (4.3.4) by e(l, z(I».

      4.5.2 Solution: The Linear Decision Rule
      Consider the form of the basic smoothing model: The objective function is quadratic,
      and the constraints are all linear equations. The first-order optimality conditions thus
      comprise a system of linear equations. This system, moreover, is highly structured, and
      its solution can be expressed in a concise recursive fonn:
      THEOREM 4.5.1. For each I ~ 0, ... , T - I, suppose we are givenx(t). Then, the
      optimal order policy is given by
                                       q(t) ~ 2:~;;;I3(I, u) d(u) - 13(1, l)x(I).                         (4.5.4)
      The coefficients 13(t, u) can be computed recursively: Treating e(T) = 13(T, T)                 ~   0, set
                                 LI(f) ~ c(l)    + h(t +       t)    + c(t + 1)[3(t + I, f + t)
                                                      e(l)
                              13(t, I) ~ I -          LI(t)


                              13(1, u) ~ [
                                               e(1    +
                                                     LI(I)
                                                             I)]   13(t + I, u)     t < u< T

      Moreover,O < 13(1, u) < I, and 13(t, u) is decreasing in u for each I.•
           The actual optimal solution can be recovered recursively from (4.5.4): First, substi­
      tute Xo for x(O), and setz*(O) ~ q(O). This determines x*(I) through (4.5.2). Next, using
      x(l) = x*(1) in (4.5.4), setz*(1) ~ q(1). Continue in this manner.
           The coefficients 13(t, u) depend on the cost factors, but nol on the demands. Thus,
      q(l) is a linear ftmction of x(l) and the d(II), u 2: t. In this sense the policy prescribes a
      linear decision rule.
           The fann oftffis linear function, moreover, is intuitively appealing: Given the current
      net inventory x(I), q(l) depends only on future demands, not past ones. This relationship is
      positive; an increase in any of the d(lI) can only increase q(t). On the other hand, the rela­
      tionship is stable; an increase in d(u) causes a smaller increase in q(I). Also, q(l) depends
      most strongly on the imminent demand d( I); subsequent demands d( u) are decreasingly im­
      portant. (This result is broadly consistent with the myopic approach above.)
           Thus, we can view each =*(t) as a smoothed version of the forecasted demands d(u),
      u ~ t. One unusually large demand increases all the prior orders, not just one or a few
      nearby ones. Thus, there is typically less variation in the z*(I) than in the d(t) themselves.
      (This observation inspires the nanle smoolhing model. Clearly, the DEL model is quali­
      tatively different in this respect. There, economies of scale induce sharply unequal or­
      ders, since z*(t)   ~   0 except at order times.)                                           ~
          The infinite-horizon version of this model leads to similar results (provideacertain
      technical conditions are met), and for some special cases the solution is even simpler:
      Suppose e(t) = -y'e and h(t) ~ -y'h, where e and h are positive constants and 0 < -y < 1.
      Let 13 denote the (unique) root in the interval (0, I) of the quadratic equation

           These extensions allow us to employ the model as an approximation of a more re­
      alistic one: Suppose the "real" model is just like the basic smoothing model, but with a
      more complex objective function of the form

                             Minimize       :L;~o[ crt. z(t))   + :L;~l h(l, x(l))
      Each of the component functions c(l, .) and h(l, ') is convex (reflecting diseconomies of
      scale) and smooth, but not necessarily symmetric. Suppose we solve this model; let z.(t),
      x.(I) denote the optimal solution.
          Now, suppose we wish to investigate how the model responds to demand changes.
      Construct a second-order approximation, that is, replace each c(t. .) and h(l, 0) by a qua­
      dratic fimction centered at the original optimal solution. This approximation is precisely
      an instance of the smoothing model (with the extensions above). Its solution accurately
      predicts the effects of small deviations from the original demands. (This is a classic ap­
      proach to parametric analysis. What is special here is the structure of the linearized op­
      timality conditions.)                                                                           Notes
           Here is another interesting extension: Suppose that, in addition to the original costs,
      there is also a cost to change the order quantity from one time to the next. Assume that
      these costs too are quadratic; add the term e(t)[z(1 - I) - z(t)f to the objective function,
      where e(t) is a positive constant, for 0 < t < T - 1. Some production activities (espe­
      cially high-volume continuous processes) entail costs of this sort. This is called the pro­
      duction smoothing model, because the objective itself favors even production levels.
           In control-systems terms therc are now two state variables, z(t - I) as well as X(I). To
      avoid confusing states and controls, define a new state variable x~(t) to represent the pre­
      vious order, and include the equation x~(I + I) = z(t) in the dynamics. The smoothing­
      cost term becomes e(t)[x~(t) - z(l)]'.
           The objective of this production-smoothing model is quadratic, so the optimality
      conditions form a system of linear equations. The optimal policy is similar to the basic
      smoothing model's, as described in Theorem 4.5.1: Given x(t) and x~(t), q(l) is a linear
      function of these state variables and the demands d(u) for u 2: I. (The 13 coefficients are
      different from those above, of course. Problem 4.17 asks you to work out the details.)
           The basic smoothing model and the production smoothing model are instances of
      an important family of discrete-time control models, called linear-quadratic control
      (LQc) models: The state of the system, the control, and the input are each described by
      a vector. The dynamics comprise linear equations, and there are no additional con­
      straints. Finally, the objective is a quadratic function of the state and control variables.
      See Appendix B.
           Provided certain technical conditions are met, the solution of such a model can be
      characterized in terms fully analogous to Theorem 4.5.1. That is, given the current state,
      the current action is a linear function of the state and of current and future inputs. The
                                                                                                       '",
      coefficients of this linear function can again be computed recursively.
          Smoothing models have the remarkable virtue that certain types of stochastic de­
      mands can be incorporated readily. Indeed, sometimes the solution is identical to that of
      the original deterministic model! This insensitivity property is less wonderful than it may
      seem, however: it is essentially an artifact of the symmetry assumptions. The solutions
      of more realistic models do depend on demand uncertainties, and for good reasons, as

m of a more re­                     shown in Chapter 9. Even so, stochastic models of this general style, albeit with differ­
oodel, but with a                   ent details, are often used to gain insight into complex systems. (Section 9.4.8.3. tor ex­
                                    ample, employs what is essentially a syrrunetry approximation.)
                                         Finally, multiproduct smoothing models can be tormulated and analyzed in the
                                    same spirit. The state and the control become fairly large vectors. But while the scale of
~onomiesof                          the model grows, its complexity does not; essentially the same methods can he used to
lmodel; let z.(t),                  solve it. In fact, in some cases, one can aggregate the products in a simple way, thus col­
                                    lapsing the large model to the single-product model above. As we shall see later, more

                             Schneeweiss [1974] discusses the use of such models as approximations when
                   the true costs are not quadratic. Stochastic models with something of the overall spirit
                   ofsmoothing models are analyzed by Aleella et aI. [1992], Denardo and Tang [1992], and
                   Graves [1999], for example. For multiproduct smoothing models see Gaalman [1978]
                   and Zipkin [1982].



Problems

4.1	 Suppose the finite production rate fL in Section 4.2.5 is itself a function oftime, say fL(t)· Both ,\(t)
     and fL(t) change slowly. (For instance, we may be able to adjust production capacity to anticipate the
     known changes in ,\(t). For now, consider fL(t) as a given, positive, continuous function.) Describe a
     reasonable policy, and explain why you expect it to work well.
4.2 Consider the finite-production-rate model of Section 4.2.5 (with constant rate fL). First, assume '\(t)
     :5 fL for all t. Modify the definitions of C*(t) and C* in (4.2.2) appropriately to approximate the
     optimal average cost. Next, assume '\(t) > fL for some t, but there is only one interval [I-,t+]
      requiring an extended production cycle. Estimate the average cost over afinite interval [0, TJ, where
      T> t+. Write a simple fommla tor the inventory x(t), I- :5 t:5 t+, assuming x(l-) = x(t+) = 0, and
      use it to approximate the average cost.
4.3	 Consider the linear-cost case of the DEL model in Section 4.3.2. Argue that the recursion (4.3.7)
     correctly computes the minimal costs c[*, t) and the order times s(t).
4.4 The proof ofTheorem 4.3.1 in the text begins with the simplifying assumptions that Xo ~ 0, all
     d(t) > 0, and all k(t) > O. Prove the result in the general case, i.e., assuming only that these
      quantities are nonnegative.
4.5	 In the DEL model suppose there are no speculation opportunities, so for every fixed t, the quantities
     c[s, t) are nonincreasing in s. Let s'(t) denote the last order time in the t-horizon problem, as in
    Algorithm Forward_DEL.
    (a)	 Using the definition of k[s, t) in (4.3.8), show that s'(t) is nondecreasing in t. (Thus, to

          determine s'(t) in iteration t, we need only search over s 2> s'(t - I).)

    (b)	 Suppose that, for some t H, s'(t H) ~ tH - I. Using part (a), prove (by induction) that tH - I is
          an order time in the t-horizon problem for all t 2> tHo Then, explain that this implies that tH is a
          planning horizon.
4.6 This problem conducts a partial sensitivity analysis ofthe DEL model: Let d denote the entire
    sequence of demands {d(t), 0 :5 t < T}, regarded as a nonnegative T-vector, and C*(d) the optimal
    cost of the DEL model with demand sequence d, assuming the cost paranleters are fixed. Argue that
    C*(d) is a continuous, nondecreasing, concave function of d. (Hint: Let 'IT denote any fixed
    sequence of order times, and C(dl'IT) the cost of using the order times 'IT to meet the demand
    sequence d. Express C*(d) in terms of the C(dl'IT). Now, derive certain relevant properties of the
    C(dl'IT), and use these to arrive at the desired conclusion.)
           What does this tell us about C*(2d), assuming we know C*(d)? Compare this finding to the
     effect of doubling ,\ in the EOQ model.
4.7 As in the previous problem, let k and c denote T-vectors describing the order-cost parameters, and
     COCk, c) the optimal cost, assuming all other parameters are held fixed. Prove that C*(k. c) is

                    4.9	 The DEL model envisions a world in which time stops at I ~ T This is a fiction, of course. The

     this model enjoys the zero-inventory property. That is, each production run begins with zero
     inventory. (Follow the proof ofTheorem 4.3.1.)
4.17 Consider the production-smoothing model of Section 4.5.3. Following t1le proof ofTheorem 4.5.1,

4.18 Let zo(l) denote a previous solution to t1le DEL model. Suppose we modify the DEL model to
     penalize deviations from this solution, adding the following term to the objective for each I:

                                        e+(t)O[O(Z(I) - o(zo(I)]   + e-(l)o[5(zo(l)   - 5(z(I)]
      Thus, if t is an order time in the new solution but not in the old one, we incur the fixed cost e +(t),
      and in the opposite case we incur e- (t). Assume tlmt e+ (t) and e- (I) are both positive, and
      e -(t) < k{t). Derive an instance of the DEL model that is equivalent to this one, and explain why

                   5.1 Introduction
                              This chapter explores systems with several products, or several locations, or both. The
                              goal is to nnderstand, both in detail and in hroad terms, what is needed to coordinate di­
                              verse and dispersed activities, so that the overall system functions effectively. This theme
                              continues in Chapter 8 in the context of stochastic demands. These two chapters. then,
                              constitnte the core of the theory of supply chains.
                                  This chapter mostly follows the scenario ofChapter 3 (continuous time, constant de­
                              mand rates). Only at the end does it treat time-varying demands.


                              5.1.1 Items: Product-Location Pairs
                              We hegin with an important observation: Multiproduct systems and multilocation systems
                              are fundamentally identical. The same models and analytical techniques can be appliedjust


                                                                                                                      107

      as well to one as the other. Indeed, a system with multiple products and locations can be
      approached in the same way. The differences, such as they are, are mainly dlfferences in
      wording.
           This parallel should not be too surprising. Demand for one product cannot be met
      by supply of another, just as demand in one place cannot be met by supply elsewhere. To
      meet the demand, it is necessary to transform the available goods, either by moving them
      or by processing them into something else. Production and transportation are both phys­
      ical transfonnations; both require time and money_ There are differences in detail, cer­
      tainly, but for our purposes such differences are superficial. So are distinctions among
      modes of transportation and types of production processes.
           So universal is this likeness that we build on it from the beginning. Instead of prod­
      ucts or locations, we work with generic entities called items. Items can indicate loca­
      tions, or products, or product-location pairs. A multi-item model can represent either
      geographically separated points, or physically distinct products, or both.
           There are a few apparent exceptions, models designed originally to capture specific
      production- or transportation-oriented features. Even then, the specificity is more a mat­
      ter of interpretation than intrinsic structure. Virtually every production-specific feature
      has some analogue in the context of transportation, and vice versa.
           This is a powerful abstraction. Many innovations in distribution management have
      been adnpted from the production sphere, and the other way around. The item approach
      allows us to conceptualize, model, and manage production and transportation activities
      in a unified manner. It may take a while to get accustomed to this idea, but it is worth the
      effort.


      5.1.2 Structural Complexity: Networks ofItems
      There are important and interesting things to learn about multiple items, even when each
      item is entirely independent of the others. Section 5.2 examines such systems.
           The rest of the chapter is concerned with items that are intrinsically linked, either
      through supply-demand relationships or through a shared supply process. Consider
      supply-demand relationships first. For example, a large retailer may purchase goods
      centrally, stock them in a central warehouse, and supply its several stores from the ware­
      house. Or a manufacturer may acquire raw materials, fabricate them into various com­
      ponents, and assemble the components into finished products.
           In such situations the items and the relationships between them form a network, specif­
      ically a directed graph. The nodes represent the items, and the arcs depict the
      supply-demand relationships. It is important to distinguish several broad network structures:
           The simplest structure is a series !Jystem (Figure 5.1.1). Here, the items represent the
      outputs of successive production stages or stocking points along a supply chain. Each
      product is used as input to make the next one; or each location supplies the next one.
      Only the first item receives supplies from outside the system, and only the last one meets
      exogenous customer demands. (The figure omits the exogenous supply and demand
      processes as well as all internal processing steps. Only the items' inventories and their
      links are shown.) Section 5.3 shows how to construct a good policy for such a system
      and to compute a simple, accurate estimate of its overall cost.

    complex than tree systems. All these more complex networks, from assembly to general
    systems, are discussed in Section 5.4. Again, the main objective is to construct a good
    policy and an accurate cost estimate.
         We can even think of purely independent items as forming a network, though a triv­
    ial one with no arcs. In light of the classification above we might call this a parallel sys­
    tem. This notion is useful conceptually: For instance, a distribution system combines the
    features ofthe series and parallel structures.

7   5.1.3 Shared Supply Processes
    Items can be linked in other ways besides supply-demand relations. Their demand
    processes may be driven by some common lU1derlying factors. For example, each arriving
    cnstomer may demand several items, not just one; or all items' demands may be influenced
    by general economic conditions. But most of the chapter assumes known, constant demand
    rates for all items, and it really doesn't matter how these rates are determined. Such de­
    mand links play no direct role in the model formulations. (Common demand drivers are
    relevant for sensitivity analysis, when we step back from a model and view it in a larger
    context, and also in certain of the variable-demand models of Section 5.7.)
          Likewise, the supply processes may be linked. At the extreme, the items may share a
    common supply process. There are several types of supply links. We explore two of them.
          First, Section 5.5 discusses the joint-replenishment problem. This model portrays a
    situation where there is an economic advantage to ordering several items at the same time,
    that is, economies of scope. Economies of scope arise, for example, when all the items
    come from a single supplier, so we can save shipment charges by synchronizing their or­
    ders. Section 5.5 shows how to exploit these economies of scope effectively. The key idea
    is to reduce the problem to an equivalent distribution system and then apply the methods
    of Section 5.4.
          Section 5.6 explores a different type of supply link, where several items share a sup­
    ply process oflirnited capacity. One example is a flexible production facility: The items
    are products, and the supply process consists of a single machine, capable of producing
    only one product at a time. This model is called the economic lot scheduling problem.
    We develop effective heuristic methods for this problem.


    5.1.4 Time-Varying Demands
    The chapter concludes with two sections on time-varying demands. Section 5.7 ap­
    proaches the issue much in the same spirit as Chapter 4, using discrete-time formula­
    tions. Following a brief discussion of simple cases, it explores discrete-time versions of
    supply-demand networks and limited-capacity systems.
          Then, we abruptly change pace in Section 5.8 to consider a broad, widely applied ap­
    proach to managing operations known as material requirements planning (or MRP). This
    is a large topic; our treatment ofit is selective, not exhaustive. The aim is to provide a brief
    overview and assessment, focusing on MRP's basic logic and its relation to the models dis­
    cussed earlier. Also, we describe several other popular approaches in passing.

5.2 Independent Items
           5.2.1 Aggregate Pe'formallce Measures
           Consider a system with many items, each satisfying the assmnptions of the EOQ model.
           The items are independent; there are no supply-demand links between them, and their
           supply and demand processes are distinct. This scenario describes a retail store or a parts
           warehouse fairly well. Because the items do not interact in any way, we can control each
           one separately from the others. That is, for each individual item, we can estimate the pa­
           rameters, solve the EOQ model, and implement the results.
                 This is essentially what most commercial inventory control programs do. Such a
           program, typically, is structured as a database with one record for each item. The order­
           triggering function and the supporting calculations are performed on an item-by-itern
           basis. (These calculations are sometimes more sophisticated than the EOQ model's,
           sometimes less, but that is beside the poi.nt here.)
                 This parallel approach to a multi-item inventory is not the only possible one, how­
           ever, or necessarily the best one. Imagine a system with thousands of distinct items. It
           would be tedious to estimate each item's cost factors separately; maintaining consis­
           tency, let alone accuracy, would be brutally difficult. In the end, moreover, we would
           have no coherent picture of the overall operation.
                This section describes a different perspective: Most inventory-related costs arise when,
           to order or stock an ite~ we draw on a few key fmnwide resources, such as working capi­
           tal and stockroom labor. (Such resources are referred to, appropriately, as cost drivers in ac­
           counting parlance.) The central managerial concerns are the total usages ofthese resources
           over all items, expressed as aggregate perfonnance measures. The most important measures
           are the total inventory investment and the aggregate order-handling workload. In this view
           the individual items still matter, but mainly insofar as they contribute to these aggregates.
                 Senior managers and even investors pay close attention to aggregate perfonnance
           measures. In situations involving thousands of items, no individual can possibly grasp
           the details of each one. Aggregate-level infonnation enables managers to monitor the ef­
           fectiveness ofthe inventory-control function and the overall health ofthe enterprise, and
           to set broad consistent operating policies.
                 Even so, ultimately we (or someone) must take action. To strike an appropriate bal­
           ance between aggregate inventory and workload, as we shall see, entails measuring or
           specifying their relative costs, implicitly or explicitly. The aggregate approach, however,
           does this once, at the aggregate level, not for each item separately.
                Nevertheless, this approach is entirely consistent with the individual-item EOQ
           model; it arrives at the same result by a different path. Given each item's resource usage
           and each resource's cost, as required by the aggregate approach, we can use these data to
           compute the individual-item costs. What we have, then. is a plausible, relatively tractable
           cost-estimation procedure for the EOQ model. Both perspectives are useful in practice.

                       We need three basic pieces of information about each item:

                        wO ~ aggregate average workload = ~ wjOFj
      (Again, it is simplest to think of cI as a single symbol, and likewise wo.) Given the as­
      sumptions above about Cj and M:'i' these two measures capture all the relevant informa­
      tion about aggregate resource usage.
           On the other hand, like all time-averages, these measures suppress the actual patterns
      of resource usage over time. Local peaks and valleys can be important for capacity­
      constrained resources, especially those measured by wo. For now, simply ignore this issue;
      Section 5.6 revisits it.


      5.2.2 The Inventory- Workload Tradeoff Curve
      The aggregate measures cI and wO are related through the qj' of course. This relation­
      ship can be expressed in a clear and simple way:
           Suppose for now that there is a fixed target level for the total inventory investment,
      and use cI to indicate that target. The remaining problem is to allocate this total invest­
      ment among the items, so as to minimize the aggregate workload wo. This problem can
      be expressed as a mathematical optimization problem over the positive variables q/

anables qi          such curve.
                          It is important to understand what the tradeoff curve does and does not do: In the
         (5.22)     language of economics, a curve of this kind is an efficient set. For any given cL the curve
                    tells us the best (i.e., smallest) achievable wo. The relationship works in the opposite di­
                    rection too; given wO, the curve indicates the best possible cI. The curve does not pre­
                    scribe a particular optimal solution, however. That means selecting a single point on the
                    curve, and to make such a choice requires knowing or deciding the relative importance
 directly: Let {    of inventory and workload. Equivalently (as explained below), we need more specific
irst-order opti­    cost infOlmation.
                          Still, the tradeoff curve can be immensely useful. First, it can be used in a diagnos­
                    tic mode. Only certain combinations of the qj correspond to efficient points. Any other
                    is inefficient; the corresponding point (d, wO) lies above (or to the right of) the curve.
                    Thus, we can compare current operations with the curve to assess their efficiency.
                          Also, the curve can serve to sharpen discussion among managers, for it summarizes
                    what is and is not possible. For example, financial and competitive pressures often sug­
         (52.3)     gest reducing inventory investment. Presuming current operations are efficient, the curve
                    indicates precisely the corresponding increase in workload. Thus informed, we can then

      one of the costs of cI Here, 11 includes 0:'., plus any other relevant costs proportional to
      el) The problem of choosing a particular point on the tradeoff curve can then be ex­
      pressed as the following two-variable classical optimization problem:
                                         Minimize            K(WO)    + TJ(cl)                            (5.2.5)
                                         subject to         (5.2.4)
      This problem is easy to solve: Just find the point on the tradeoff curve with slope -TJ/K.
           Here is an equivalent approach: Given the parameters                 K   and 11, directly estimate the
      cost factors required for the EOQ model, item by item:
                                  k} =   KWj       h} = 11C}          j = I, ... ,J

      Thus, we determine the k} and hj in two steps, first measuring the "physical" quantities
      Wjand c.i' and then using the factors K and 11 to convert them into cost rates.
           Next, use these cost factors in a separate EOQ model for each item. The EOQ for­
      mula now takes the fonn

                                            .

                                                                        j   ~   I, ... ,J
                                                          11 Cj
      Comparing this with (5.2.3) above, the ratio TJ/K corresponds precisely to the dual vari­
      able ~. Substituting these q} into the sums defining wO and cI yields
                               wO = Y(~WcAJ.)e)                   cI~ Y(~wcAJ.)(~)                        (5.2.6)

      Multiplying these two equations eliminates TJ and K entirely, and the end result is (5.2.4).
      Thus, this point (cL wO) lies on the tradeoff curve. Moreover, it is easy to check that the
      slope of the curve at this point is indeed -TJ/K.
           In fact, the individual-item approach can recover the entire tradeoff curve: Just let
      the ratio TJ/K range over all positive values. Using (5.2.6), each value generates a point
      (wO, cl) lying on the CUlve, and the locus of these points is the curve itself. Thus, these
      two approaches are truly equivalent.
           Given 11 and   K,   the optimal total average cost is simply
                                          C* = CA      + K(WO) + TJ(cI)                                   (5.2.7)
                                                ~ CA   + V2(KW)(TJCA)J.
                                                ~ CA   + y2(KTJ)(WCA)J.

             (5.2.5)   items. The better inventory-control programs include cost-estimation modules ofthis kind.

                       items with small demands. There are tangible benefits to consolidating a product line into

                            In some special cases such questions can be answered easily, using the results for
                       the EOQ model: Suppose allJ items are identical, and each of the ~ doubles, all else re­

                       J doubles. Each 1; is unchanged, but there are now twice as many of them, so cI itself
                       doubles. This is a much larger increase than in the first case.
Foundations ofInventory Management


                                                                                    CA
      As these simple examples illustrate, it is not enough to know the change in itself.
We need to know something about how the change is distributed among the items. Re­
calling the formulas above, two additional pieces of information are relevant, namely,
the changes in the average workload wand the variety index J*. Now, it often happens
that the wJ are nearly constant, so w changes little in response to demand shifts. This
leaves J", as the remaining detenninant of performance. In the first example above J..
does not change at all, but in the second J. doubles along with cA; this accounts for the
difference in performance in the two cases.
      The variety index J* requires a great deal of information about the individual items.
Sometimes it is possible to specify a particular distributional form for the item-specific
data. and thus to compute J* in tenns of a few parameters. See Problem 5.3.
      Aggregate-level sensitivity issues are often expressed in terms of turnover. Recal1,
in the single-item context, the turnover is just the ratio 'A/l. The aggregate tunlOver is the
corresponding ratio cA/cI Thus, ifCA increases, we expect turnover to increase,provided
J.. does not increase too much. In general, we need to know how J.. changes, as well as
cA., to predict the effects on turnover.
      The name "turnover" is sometimes attached to alternative measures. One is pA/c!,
where
                                       PA = total revenue rate
                                              = "£;P;A;

In this usage, turnover means the ratio of sales to inventory investment. This is a com­
plex measure, and it is hard to interpret sensibly. It is helpful to express it as the product
of two more basic ratios:

                                      pI. =    (PA)(CA)
                                      el        cA   el

The second term is the original turnover discussed above. The first ratio p)JcA is the ag­
gregate markup. This too can be affected in subtle ways by demand changes. For in­
stance, a shift in demand towards high-margin items increases it, and this can occur even
while CA and cI remain constant.
     Generally, in working with aggregate pertonnance measures, it is wise to learn pre­
cisely how the calculations are perfonned, and to reckon carefully the various factors that
influence them. This may sound obvious, but it is easy to forget.


5.2.5 Aggregate Sensitivity Analysis in Action
One particular experience taught me the importance ofcare in these matters: Some years
ago] was asked to advise the executives of a large conglomerate. Every month they re­
viewed the financial performance of their subsidiaries. There were several hundred of
these, and many were themselves quite large, complex businesses. So, the reviews
tended to focus on a few aggregate performance measures. Total sales (pl.) and turnover
(pA/el) received close attention.
                     Chapter 5   Several Products and Locations                                             119

ldividual items.          Then, we estimated the variety index (J.). This was not easy: We had no item-spe­

[lges, as well as         The results were c1earcut: Most of the subsidiaries' J*'s had increased substantially.
                     Further investigation provided the explanation: The sales expansion had come mainly
;. One is pAlc!,     through opening new markets in widespread geographic regions. The effective number
                     of items had grown even faster than revenues, so the inventory needed to support them
                     had increased sharply. (This also explained the price reductions; managers were cutting
                     prices aggressively to attract new customers.) In such circumstances, declining turnover
                     was perfectly natural. Far from losing control, the European managers were apparently
                     doing their jobs well.

                     5.2.6 ABCAnalysis
                     ABC analysis is another tactic for coping with a large number of items. Essentially, it
                     means dividing the items into a few groups. Commonly, three groups are used, labeled
                     A, B, and C on the basis of sales volume. The A items have the largest values ofPjAJ' the
'AICA is the ag­     B items medium values, and the C items the smallest. Normally, the A group includes
I3Ilges. For in­     only a few items (say, 10%), the B group is larger (30%), and the C group is the largest
::-an OCCUf even     (60%). Even so, the A items typically account for the bulk of total sales (often as much
                     as 80%), while the C items cover only a small fraction, with the B items somewhere in

                     important ones, the C group, putting the rest in the B group. This is a preliminary step
                     to other modes of analysis, such as parameter estimation and modeling. The idea is to
                     focus effort where it counts the most. Thus, the A items deserve the most intensive data­
                     collection and model-formulation efforts, while relatively crude methods can be used for

120        Foundations afInventory Management


               The basic notion of dividing items into groups can be usefully applied to any large
           data set. It is not just a technique of inventory analysis, but rather much more general.


5.3 Series Systems
           5.3.1 The Setting
           This section analyzes a series system. There are J items numbered j = 1, ... , J from
           first to last. The items represent the outputs of successive production stages, or stocking
           points along a supply chain. Demand occurs, at rate A, only for item 1, and an external
           somce supplies item 1. All other supply links are internal; item I supplies item 2, item
           2 feeds item 3, and so on. See Figure 5.3.1. Another word for "item" in this context is
           stage. A series system is sometimes called a multistage system.
                 Stock moves in discrete batches, as in the EOQ model. An order is a decision to
           move a batch to any stage, whether the batch comes from the supplier or a prior stage.
           The stages do not make their own order decisions, however; information and control are
           fully centralized. The order decisions must be coordinated: it makes no sense to order a
           batch to be sent to one stage, when the prior stage has insufficient inventory. (Neverthe­
           less, we shall see later that the system can be operated effectively in a decentralized man­
           ner.) The external supplier always has ample stock available.
                 All demand must be met as it occurs; stockouts are forbidden. There are economies
           of scale in the form of fi"Xed costs for all orders. (If not, the entire system could operate
           as a perfect flow system.) So, the basic issue here, as in the EOQ model, is to find a good
           balance between these fixed costs and inventory holding costs. Denote
                                    ~i =    fixed cost for orders of item j
                                   h; =     inventory holding-cost rate for item j
                                l;(t)   ~   inventory of item} at time t
           (The reason for the primes will become apparent shortly.)
                Each stage requires precisely one unit from its predecessor to produce a unit of its
           own item. This is no real restriction: If a stage requires more or less than one unit, just
           redefine the quantity units of items j < J to reflect their usages in the end product. For
           example, consider a two-stage system, where both items are originally measured in tons,
           and it requires fwD tons of item 1 to make one ton of item 2. Measnre item 1 in two-tons
           instead; just one of these new units is needed to produce a unit of item 2. Accordingly,
           revise h;. to be twice its original value.
                There is a constant leadtime Li for stage:i orders. (So, implicitly, there are no ca­
           pacity limits.) Shipments in transit between stages comprise pipeline inventories. These

      The original I;(t) is sometimes called the local or installation inventory of item j. The
      prime indicates that it is a local quantity.
          Also, let
                          h} = echelon-inventory holding-cost rate for itemj

                             =hi-h}-l
      where h o = O. Assume that each hj > O. (This is usually the case: Suppose Cj is the vari­
                                                h;
      able order-cost rate for item), and includes financing costs only. To create a unit of
      item} incurs all the costs Cj, i <j, so h; = a"l/5,jcj, where a is the interest rate. Thus, the
      echelon holding cost is just hj = CiCj, that is, hj rel1ects the value added at stage j. And
      cj > 0 inunediately implies hj > O. If h; also includes a physical handling cost ilj, the   il;
      must also increase, or at least not decrease too fast. This is usually true also; physical
      handling tends to be more expensive downstream.)
           With these definitions the systemwide inventory cost rate becomes

                                      ~h;~(t) ~ ~hj~(t)       for all I
      Thus, the echelon inventories track stocks and their costs throughout the system just as
      well as the local inventories.
           Echelon inventories offer distinct advantages: Consider a two-stage system. Figure
      5.3.3 graphs the local inventories of the two items. Item 2's inventory I;(tJ behaves like
      that of a single-item system: It decreases at the constant rate A, except at order epochs,
      when it jumps up by the order amount. However,         I; (I) describes a fairly complex step
      function.
           Figure 5.3.4 shows the corresponding echelon inventories. Of course, 1,(1) ~ I;(t),
      bulll(t) = I;(t) + I;(t) too looks like the inventory of a single-item system. (The dashed
                  I;
      lines show (t).) The jumps occur at stage I orders only; when stage 2 orders but stage
      I does not, II(t) does not change.
           Clearly, this idea extends to general J: For every j. ~(I) decreases at rate A, except
      at stage-j order epochs, when it jumps by the amount ordered. Thus, echelon inventories
      simplify the task of inventory-cost accounting.
           Reconsider the positive-leadtime case for a moment. Let

                               Lj = forward echelon leadtime for itemj
                                  =    li>iL~
      This is the minimal time required to move a unit ofitemj through the subsequent stages
      to the customer; note, LJ   = O. Given a feasible policy for the zero-Ieadtime system, one
      can construct a corresponding feasible policy for the "real" positive-leadtime system:
      Just shift each order arrival of item j back in time by Lj. Equivalently, shift the start of
      each shipment to j back by L} = L j + Lj. (Thus, the initial order arrivals for j < J occur
      at negative times. This is necessary for feasibility, assuming the system starts empty and
      demand begins at time t = 0.) It is easy to see that, except for a similar time shift._ the

      ~(t) are identical in the two systems. Conversely, given a feasible policy for the real sys­
      tem, we can construct a policy for the zero-leadtime system by the reverse transforma­
      tion. So, we can and do focus on zero-Ieadtime systems.


      5.3.3 Policy Characteristics
      For practical purposes, and analytical purposes too, we would like to focus on rela­
      tively simple policies. Fortunately, good policies share certain simplifying qualitative
      characteristics.
           A policy is nested if, for all j. whenever stage j orders, so does stage j + I. Here, an
      order at one stage triggers orders at all downstream stages; in other words, all stages in an
      echelon order together. Consequently, stage J orders most frequently among all the stages,
      and stage l1east. It turns out that nested policies are the only ones we need consider:
      THEOREM 5.3.1. Every non-nested policy is dominated by a nested policy. (The
      nested policy has lower inventories and no more orders.)
      (Remember, the proofs ofthis and subsequent results are postponed until Section 5.3.8.)
           Another important policy characteristic is the zero-inventory property, encountered
      in Chapter 3. Under a zero-inventory policy, each item orders only when its inventory
      Ij(t-) is zero. (Recall, Ij(O-) ~ 0, so the first order certainly satisfies this condition.)
      THEOREM 5.3.2. Every non-zero-inventory policy is dominated by a zero-inventory
      policy.
      Thus, we can restrict attention to policies with both these characteristics. Note, under a
      nested, zero-inventory policy, item) orders only when its echelon inventory IJt) is zero.
           A stationary-znten.'al policy means just that: For each item the time intervals be­
      tween orders are equal. Such policies are generally easier to implement than others, and
      they are certainly easier to analyze. (Stationary intervals imply equal order quantities,
      of course. For the complex networks of the next section, however, it is more natural to
      work with order intervals, so we do the same here to maintain consistency. One can
      show that stationary-interval policies do dominate all others. We do not actually use this
      fact, however.)
           Consider a policy with all three properties, i.e., a nested, zero-inventory, stationary-
      interval policy. Let
              uJ = order interval for item)

              gj   = h}.

           C(u)    = average cost of the policy specified by u
      Each l,(t) describes the periodic pattern familiar from the EOQ model. Therefore, ap­
      plying the EOQ model's calculations to each item,

      Each '0 is a positive-integer multiple of Uj+ 1. The problem of selecting the best such pol­
      icy can be stated as follows:

ing qualitative
                    lutions. without ever reaching a best one.) Here is the plan: First, we solve a simpler
                    problem called the relaxed problem. Its optimal cost is a lower bound on the actual min­
;+   1. Here, an
                    imal cost. Next, by carefully rounding off the relaxed problem's solution, we construct a

                    feasible solution. Also, we compute a simple upper bound on this feasible solution's cost;
g all the stages,
                    this provides an upper bound on the minimal cost. These two bounds are close together;
[ consider:
                    they differ by only a few percent. Consequently, the feasible solution is a good one, and

                         Thus, (5.3.3) is a standard nonlinear program; one way to solve it is to use a stan­
                    dard nonlinear-progranuning algorithm. But there is a better way. Problem (5.3.3) has a
                    great deal of special structure. We shall apply an algorithmic strategy (a variant of the
                    active-set strategy; see, e.g., Luenbcrger [1984], pp. 326-330) that exploits this special
                    structure to develop a simple, fast method to solve (5.3.3).
                         The key idea is to distinguish which constraints in (5.3.3) are binding at the optimal

      It is easy to solve this problem for any A~, as shown below, and it turns out that, for the
      right subsetA~, say A:, the solution to (5.3.3[A:]) also solves (5.3.3) itself. (Given u*,
                         u;
      set A: = {j E A : = U;+l}' As Problem 5.7 asks you to prove, u* is the unique solu­
      tton to (5.3.3[A:]).) So, the problem becomes, find an optimal subset A:.
            First, let us solve (5.3.3[A~]) for any given subset A~. Any A~ divides the items N
      into groups or clusters, where the items within each cluster are forced to have equal uj .
      Let Nm denote an individual cluster. setting the index m to the largest item-numberj in
      the cluster. The collection of clusters is the partition N = {N= m E N\A~}. (N is a spe­
      cial partition. The items in each cluster are consecutive, and the clusters are ordered by
      their indices m. To emphasize this fact 1 N is sometimes called a directed partition.)
      Figure 5.3.5 shows one possible partition. The ovals designate the clusters. The set A~
      corresponds to arcs inside ovals, i.e., those that do not cross cluster boundaries. Also, let
                         prev(m)    =   cluster index just before m
                         next(m)    =   cluster index just after m                         mEN\A~

      where next(J) = 0, and prev(m) = 0 for the lowest index m. So, for all m, Nm = {prev(m)
      + 1, ... ,m}.
          Now, (5.3.3[A~]) separates into INI independent subproblems, one for each cluster.
      The subproblem for cluster Nm is

                    nect them by line segments, as in Figure 5.3.6. The resulting curve is a function ofg, for
                    g in the interval [0, g(N J )]; this function is piecewise-linear and increasing. It shows how

                    also piecewise-linear and increasing; it connects some but not all of the original points.
                    Use the concave function to specify a partition N: The points on the new curve, exclud­

                    those at "kinks" of the curve.) Equivalently, A~ consists of points below the curve

     This partition satisfies the optimality conditions: The slopes of the new func­
tion's line segments are precisely the 7r(Nm ). These are nonincreasing, by concavity,
so (5.3.5) holds. Also, to cut any N m means to add a point j E A ~ n N m to the curve,
replacing Nm's line segment by two segments, like the dashed lines in Figure 5.3.7,
one each for N-;'" and N~. That new point lies below (or on) N",'s segment, so the new
segments have nondecreasing slopes, i.e., 'IT(N-;"') ::'S 7r(N~). Thus, the cut satisfies
(5.3.6).
     Thus, to detennine an optimal partition N and thereby solve the relaxed problem,
we need only concavify a piecewise-linear function. There are several ways to do this.
The following algorithm, in essence, concavifies the curve through (0, 0) and the nextj
points, first for j ~ I, and then for each successive j up to J:

putes k(~) ~ k(Npc~(j») + k(~), g(~) = g(N"cev(;}) + g(~), 7T(~) ~ k(N)lg(N), and
prev(j) ~ prev(prevU»).

THEOREM 5.3.5. Algorithm Series_Relaxed determines an optimal partition, and so
the corresponding solution (5.3.4) solves the relaxed problem.

This algorithm is easy to implement, and its calculations are simple. (One can show that
it requires O(J) time.) Let N* denote an optimal partition, and u*(m) the optimal u(m)
in (5.3.4).

       5.3.5 Constructing a Feasible Policy Using a Base Period
       Next, we use the solution of the relaxed problem to construct a low-cost, feasible solu­
       tion to (5.3.2).
             Fix some base period 11.. This can be any convenient time interval, such as a day or
       a week (not necessarily the same as the original time-unit used to measure t). We shall
       construct a solution where each uj is an integer-power-of-two multiple of g. (That is, uj
       is H., or 2!L or 4g, et cetera, or ~!L or !:l!f, et cetera) There are often practical reasons to
       impose a base period; it is simpler to speak about days, or even half-days, than some
       bizarre interval like 0.962 days. In any case, the base period will help us construct a fea­
       sible policy; anY!i will do. (Section 5.3.6 drops this base-period restnction.)

                     resolve ties by rounding down.) TIlls policy is feasible: Since the u*(m) are nonincreasing

      We must evaluate C+(g) over three intervals, [1, X(2), [X(2), X(4)), and [X(4), 2). Over the third

      is C+(u*) = 10.954. The calculations for the other intervals are similar. The third one turns out to
      be best.
           The solution is thus u+(2) = 2g* = 3.651, u +(4) = 11* = 1.826, and its eost is C+* = 10.954.
      So, c+*/c- = 10.954110.928 = 1.002. This solution is at most 0.2% above optimal, much better
      than the guaranteed 2%.


      5.3.7 Discussion: Coordination and Sensitivity
      To summarize, determine a policy in two steps. Solve the relaxed problem, and then
      round offits solution in a careful way, depending on whether or not a base period is spec­
      ified. If so, the policy's cost is no worse than 6% above optimal; if not, the error bound
      reduces to 2%. These worst-case bounds are conservative; often, the cost of the heuris­
      tic policy is even beller (closer to the lower bound) than the bound indicates.

ntire vector u +            We spoke at the outset ofthe need to coordinate the items. How exactly does the pol­
.ch piece C+ (11)     icy do this? The key idea is to coordinate the timing ofevents throughout the system. The
these solutions.      stages are partitioned into clusters. Within each cluster, the policy tells us to synchronize
                      the stages; order for all of them at the same times. Between clusters, the power-of-two
.....,-, so Theorem   policy enforces a partial synchronization. Each cluster's orders coincide with some, but
                      not necessarily all, of those of the next downstream cluster, specifically, either with
                      every downstream order, or every other order, or every 4, etc. Finally, cluster N/s orders,
                      and therefore every cluster's orders, occur regularly, at equal time intervals.
                            Among conceivable coordination mechanisms, this is a very simple one. It is re­
                      markable that it performs so well.
                            Still, this is a centralized control scheme. It is possible, however, to implement the
than 2% above         same policy \'v'ith a minimal degree of central direction: Because the stages within each
                      cluster all use the same order interval (and order quantity), only the last one actually
                      holds inventory. Whenever any earlier stage receives a batch, it processes the batch im­
                      mediately and passes it through to the next stage. With this rule in place, we need only
;.3.8,                manage the flow of goods between clusters. Imagine that each cluster operates an
                      EOQ-like policy, based on its own local inventory. The last cluster N J orders q + (J) ~
                      AU +(J) quantity-units every u +(J) time-units, and transmits these orders upstream to
                      cluster Nprev(J)' Cluster Nprev(J) views these orders as discrete demands; it fills them
                      as they occur, as if they were exogenous, by transferring batches downstream to clus­
                      ter N J . Cluster Nprev(J) in turn places orders with its predecessor, cluster Nprev(prev(J»'
                      In actual physical units, each of Np«v(J/s orders is for the quantity q + (prev(J)) ~
                      Au+(prev(J)); in terms of the implicit demands Nprev(J) sees, each order is the inte­
                      ger q+(prev(J))/q "'(J) = u+(prev(J))/u+(J). So, cluster Np'~(J) operates just like the
'. Over the third     single-item, discrete-demand EOQ model of Problem 3.7. Likewise, every other clus­
                      ter receives orders from its successor, treats these orders as its own demands, and
                      places orders with its predecessor.
                           Clearly, this approach correctly implements the poTicy. It is necessary, of course, to
                      specify the clusters in advance and tell each one its order interval (or order size). In real
                      time, however, there is no need for centralized information and control. Each cluster
                      monitors only its own local inventory. The orders passed between them provide suffi­
of this solution      cient information to coordinate the system as a whole.
)De turns out to            This equivalence between local and centralized control is a powerful idea in prac­
                      tice, for a local-control scheme is often much easier to manage. This issue is revisited in
c*   ~ 10.954.        Section 5.8 and Chapter 8. Also, whether local or centralized, the policy's orders can be
ai, much better       driven by time or stock quantities, as in the EOQ model; in certain situations, one may
                      be more convenient than the other.
                           Let us now consider the overall performance of the system. The relaxed problem's
                      cost C- accurately estimates the total optimal cost and the cost of the heuristic policy.
                      Given an optimal partition N*, this quantity is
em, and then
                                                                                                            (5.3.7)
eriod is spec­
, error bound         We can use this fonnula to address sensitivity issues:
)f the heuris­            Suppose A changes. Examining (5.3.5) and (5.3.6), we see that the optimal partition
'S.                   N* remains the same. Each term of C- in (5.3.7) is proportional to      y:;..,
                                                                                              so C- itself is
134   Foundations of111ventmy Management


      too. Thus, the effect of A on the overall cost (as approximated by L) is the same as in the
      EOQmodel.
           Also, each u*(m) changes as I/y'I;, so the (relaxed) relative order frequency
      u*(m)Iu*(next(m)) is insensitive to A. Consequently. u + (m) is approximately proportional
      to lIy'1;, though not exactly. And while the true relative frequency u + (m )Iu + (next(m))
      may change with A.• the change is limited. (In fact, this ratio may go up or down by a fac­
      tor of 2, but no more. and of course it always remains at least I. See Problem 5.10.)
           Similarly, cost-factor changes affect C- as in the EOQ model, provided the ky all
      change by a conunon multiple, and likewise the hp For instance. if ky = KWj and hj ~ 1)Cj
      as in2ection 5.2, and K and 1) change but not the wj and cj , then C- is proportional
      to yK1).
           In this special case, moreover, one can easily construct an aggregate inventory-work­
      load tradeoff curve, estimating wO and cI by their values in the relaxed problem. The op­
      timal partition N* must be determined only once, since it is independent of K and 1). The
      tradeoff curve is precisely (5.2.4), the same !orrn as in an independent-item model, with
      the aggregate system parameters redefined as follows: For any subset M (;; N let
                                                          w(M) ~ lj<Mwj

      the original items, but indirectly.)

      the ratios 1T({i)) ~ k/g; are nonincreasing. Thus, C- is forced above C-- only when a
      downstream stage has a larger ratio than an upstream stage.
           This observation suggests a crude but useful guideline for fixed-cost (or order­
      workload or setup-time) reduction efforts: Focus attention on downstream stages. While
      reductions anywhere are welcome, downstream fixed costs have the greatest system­
      wide performance effects.

                     PROOF. We prove the result for a two-stage system. (problem 5.5 asks you to extend it
                     to general J.) Consider a feasible, non-nested policy. Suppose in particular that, at time
                     t, stage I orders but stage 2 does not. Let u be the earliest time after t when stage 2 does
                     order. Thus, all stock arriving at stage 1 at time t must remain there at least until u. Now,
                     consider an alternative policy, where the stage-l order at t is postponed until u; other­
                     wise (before t and after u), the new policy is identical to the old one. Clearly, 12(s) is the
                     same in both policies, but I~{s) is lower in the new one, t :5 S < u, and the total numbers
                     of orders at both stages remain the same. Thus, the new policy dominates the old one.
                     Clearly, this construction can be repeated to eliminate all non-nested order times t.

- only when a        numbered such item. Let t be the previous time j orders. Construct a better policy: Post­
                     pone all or part ofj's order at t until u. Specifically, reduce the order at t by as much as
lst (or order­       possible, Le., the smaller of Ij\u -) and the original order quantity at t, while increasing
stages. While        the order at u by the same amount. This new policy is clearly feasible. The number of or­
atest system-        ders for itemj is no more than before, and the other item's orders are unaffected. Also,
                     [,Is) is the same as before for i '" j, but [;Is) is less, t <; S < u. Outside this time interval
                     nothing changes. So, the new policy dominates the original one. If Ij(u -) remains posi­
                     tive, repeat this procedure until it is driven to zero.
                           Now, ifj = 1, this process creates no new bad order times. Ifj = 2, however, it in­
                     creases I{(s) over certain intervals before u, and so may create some bad order times in­
                     volving item 1. In this case, apply the same method to eliminate them.
136   Foundations oflrwentory Management


           At this point, the earliest bad order time, if any, comes after u. We can repeat this
      procedure as long as there are any bad order times, pushing the earliest one later and
      later, while improving the policy at each step.
      THEOREM 5.3.3. The optimal cost C- ofthe relaxed problem is a lower bound on the
      average cost of any feasible policy.
      (We remarked in Section 5.3.3 that stationary-interval policies dominate all others. In
      view of the previous two theorems, then, we already know that this assertion is true. The
      following argument, however, uses only the nestedness and zero-inventory properties.)
      PROOF. Consider any feasible, zero-inventory policy. Let OFP) denote the total num­
      ber of orders for item j during the time interval (0, t), aud cet) the total cost. Thus,

      Now, for each j, consider the integral here as a mathematical quantity, ignoring all the
      other items, constrained only by I,{s) "" 0 and the demand rate A. Given OFj(t), this quan­
      tity is minimized by spacing the orders out equally over (0, t) (as in Problem 3.2), in
      which case fb ~(s) ds = i4A[tIOFj(t)]t. Thus,

      the inequalities (5.3.5) are all strict. (Unot, one can construct an equivalent partition

      N m into the two clusters N~ and N;, let u I be the corresponding solution (5.3A), and

                    ing the argument above (for the special case A __ ~ A), we see that the optinoal partition
                    for Nm's subproblem has a single subcluster, Nm itself, and the optimal solution is the
                    subvector (U7)j.Nm' Thus, u- solves (5.3.8).

                                     Actually, the approach works even for fully general systems, but only under a
                                severe restriction involving leadtimes, as explained below. Also, the notation and
                                analysis become more complex in the general case. For these reasons we focus on
                                tree systems.
                                      Let us fonnalize the network expressing the system's stmcture: It is a directed graph,
                                specified by the pair of sets (N, A). The nodes N represent the items; J = INI is the num­
                                ber ofitems. The arcs A describe the supply-demand or input-output relations. An arc from
.blem 5.9 asks                  ito j, denoted (i, j) E A, means that some of item i is used to produce or supply item j. (If
                                there are several i with (i. j) E A, then all the inputs i are required for item j.)
                                      This graph is connected but acyclic; no group of items is independent of the others,
                                and no item is used, directly or indirectly, to produce itself. We can (and do) number the
                                items so that i < j whenever (i, j) < A. If (i, j) E A, we say i is an (immediate) predeces­
                                sor ofj, and j is a sUCCessor of i. Define
                                    Pre (j) ~ set of predecessors ofj
                                    Sue (i) = set of successors of i
                                These sets list each item's immediate inputs and outputs. A start item is one with no pred­
                                ecessor, and an end item is one with no successor. Only start items receive supplies from
                                outside the system; in a production setting they represent the raw materials. Only end
                                items have exogenous demands.
                                     In these terms an assembly system has one end item J. and each i < J has only one
                                successor. An item may have several predecessors, however (unlike a series system). A
                                distribution system, conversely, has one start item I, and each j > I has only one prede­
140   Foundations ofInvenlOlY Management


      cessor. An item may have several successors. The official definition of a tree s}'stem is a
      bit more intricate: Ignoring the directions of the arcs for the moment, the undirected net­
      work has no circuits; in other words, there is a unique (undirected) path connecting any
      two nodes. Provided this condition holds, an item may have several predecessors and
      successors. In all these cases the number of arcs is precisely IAI = INI - I = J - 1.
           The cost factors ~j and hi have the same meaning as in a series system, as do the lo­
      cal inventories li(I). Also, let
                                          Aj = demand rate for itemj
                                    x.;
      Only an end item may have > O. (This is no real restriction. If some non-end item does
      have Ai > 0, add a new item/, to the network with (j, j") E A, kr ~ 0, hi" = hi, and
      A'l" = Aj, and reset Aj = O. Usually, every end item has A,f > 0, but this is not strictly
      necessary; see Section 5.4.7.)


      5.4.2 Leadtimes and Quantity Units
      Each arc (i, j) has an associated leadtime L;j' Also, each start itemj has order leadtime
      Lj. These are non-negative constants. The corresponding zero-Ieadtime system has the
      same datH. except all L;; and L;. are O.
             Consider some itemj with several predecessors. The Lij may include item-specific
      transportation times as well as assembly time, so in general the Lij need not be equal over
       i. Now, for a batch of) to be finished and available at time I, a corresponding batch of
      item i must be released at time t - Lij from every i e Pre (j). It makes no sense to speak
      of placing an order for item) at a certain time if these L;j are different. Rather, the key
      events are now the departure and arrival times of batches on specific arcs. The inventory
      li(l) depends on all arrivals to and departures from).
             Later, we shall assume the Lij and Li are zero. But, suppose some are really positive.
      Is this system equivalent to the corresponding zero-Ieadtime one? The answer, fortu­
      nately, is yes for tree systems, but not otherwise.
             For an assembly system, the transfonnation is essentially the same as for a series sys­
      tem: Let L ~ be the sum of the arc leadtimes along the path from ito J. (In a series sys­
      tem this is the forward echelon leadtime. Note, LJ ~ 0.) Starting with a policy for the
      zero-leadtime system, shift each order event (arrival or departure) at i back in time by
      L--;, to obtain an equivalent policy for the real system. For example, suppose that L"3 =
      15, and in the zero-lcadtirne system an order of item 3 arrives at time t = 122. In the real
      system, that order arrives at time 122 - IS = 107.
             To visualize this transformation, draw the network as in Figure 5.4.1. Here, each arc
      (i,)) is drawn horizontally with length proportional to Llj, so L-;is just the horizontal dis­
      tance from i to J. Suppose some event affects the zero-leadtime system at time t. To de­
      tennine the appropriate shift, imagine placing a copy of the network on the time axis so
      that item Jlines up with I. Then, if the event affects item i, find the location of i on the
      graph, and schedule the event at that time, namely at 1 - L-;. In the example above, put­
      ting node 5 att ~ 122, node 3 appears at time 107.
             Incidentally, this sort of drawing is used in project scheduling, and it is interesting to
      interpret the network in that context. Forget about demands and inventories for the mo­

                  an assembly system, this means that all items are measured in terms of their usage in
                  the end product. (A general system cannot be simplified in this manner, again because
                  of multiple paths between items. The model must include input usages explicitly. Apart
                  from the extra notation required, however, this is not a serious difficulty like the lead­
                  time-balance issue.)
                       From now on assume all Lij and L; are zero, and every input requirement is one.


                  5.4.3 Echelons and Echelon Inventories
                  Echelon i comprises item i itself, its successors, their successors, and so on. That is, ech­
                  elon i includes i and all subsequent items which use i as input, directly or indirectly.
                      The echelon inventory of item i is all the inventory in echelon i, and its echelon de­
                  mand rate is the total demand over items in echelon i. These quantities can be computed
                  recursively, starting with the end items:
                                                     1,(t) = f,{t)      + Lj,suc(,) 1;(t)
                                                       Ai = A;        + L.iESuc(i) ~i
                  The echelon holding cost is

as a reference
                  In an assembly system, for example, echelon i comprises the items along the path from

144   Fou.lldation.~ ofI/lven/my   Management


          As in Section 5.3, these echelon-level quantities are simpler than local ones. Again,
      ~(t)declines at a constant rate, now Ai' except at order epochs, when it jumps up by the
      order quantity. Also, the total holding-cost rate at time t is again 2,jhi1i(t) ~ 2,i'j~(t).


      5.4.4 Policy Characteristics
      Zero-inventory policies continue to dominate others. (The proof ofTheorem 5.3.2 con­
      tinues to hold nearly as is; only modest technical formalities must be added.) On the
      other hand, stationary-intervalpolicies are not necessarily dominant. Still, they are con­
      venient, and, as shown below, they do perform well.
            A nestedpolicy is one where an order for item i triggers an order for each of its suc­
      cessors, and hence throughout echelon i. In an assembly system, nested policies domi­
      nate others, as in a series system. (The proof of Theorem 5.3.1, with minor adaptations,
      still applies.) Otherwise, nested policies need not be dominant. For example, consider
      the simple distribution system shown in Figure 5.4.5, where a warehouse (item I) sup­
      plies two retailers (items 2 and 3). Suppose A2 = A" all the hj are equal, k] ~ k2 , but k,
      is much larger than k] and k2 • It makes seuse to order items I and 2 relatively often, but
      item 3 less frequently. (Since item I sometimes orders when 3 does not, such a policy is
      not nested.) Under a nested policy the system either incurs the cost k3 too often or car­
      ries too much inventory (at I or 2) to supply stage 2.
            Nevertheless, some situations require a nested policy, not because it is less costly as
      measured by the model, but rather because it is easier to implement. If so, we say the sys­
      tem is nested. This distinction is unnecessary, of course, for an assembly system. For
      now, we focus on nested tree systems only. (Section 5.4.7 describes the adjustments re­
      quired to deal with non-nested systems.)
            Consider a policy with all three properties. Redefine

                                                       gj = hJAi
      Then, the average cost of policy u is precisely (5.3.1); that is,

                                                C(u) = 2,j   [5 + ~

                     As in Section 5.3.4, the principal idea is to identify the "right" subset, A:; the solution

. we say the sys­         Again, any subset A= determines a partition N of N: Remove all the arcs in the net­
bly system. For      work e~rcf?pt those in A =. The result is a collection of connected subnetVo/Orks. The nodes
adjustments re-      in each subnetwork form a cluster N m' (As for a series system, we can set the index m to
                     the largest item-number in the cluster, but this is not essential.) Let Am denote the arcs
                     connecting them. Figure 5.4.6 illustrates this idea. Notice that each subnetwork (N"" A",)
                     is itself a tree system. (If the original network is an assembly system, then so is each sub­
                     network, and likewise for distribution systems.) Also, the clusters fonn a cluster net­
                     work: The nodes li are the cluster indices m, and the arcs 4 are pain; (m, n) such that
                      (i, j) < A for some i < N", and j < NO' (These (i, j) are precisely A\A~. For each cluster­
                      arc (m, n) <4, there is a unique original arc (i,j) connecting Nm and N".) The cluster net­
                      work too is a tree system.
                          The solution to    (5.4,I[A~])     is precisely (5.3.4), i.e.,
                                                      u(m) ~ [21T(N",)]1!2                        m   <Ii
                                                      Uj       ~     u(m)                         jENm
                     The feasibility condition, the analogue of (5.3.5), is
                                                      1T(N",)      <':   1T(N,)            (m, n)<4                    (5.4.2)
                     To cut a cluster, just remove some arc in the corresponding subnetwork; equivalently, re­
                     move an arc (i, j) from A=. This breaks the cluster Nm containing i andj into the pair
                     (N:, N:), where (i, j) points from N: to N:. The optimality condition requires that

      As in Theorem 5.3.4, these two conditions are necessary and sufficient for the corre­

          Here is a useful way to express the optimality condition: Define

            There are several ways to detennine an optimal partition. Here is one: It starts with

                     The overall algorithm just invokes this procedure once with (M, B) ~ (N, A). The final
                     partition N* consists of clusters M with 'Y' 2> 0, and so it does satisfy the optimality con­
                     dition (5.4.3). The procedure uses the minimal-capacity cut (M-;, Mt) in order to main­
                     tain the feasibility condition (5.4.2). (This works, by an argument like the proof ofThe­
                     orem 5.3.4.)
                          This algorithm is not quite as simple as Algorithm Series_Relaxed. There are sim­
                     pler specialized methods for assembly and distribution systems. (Actually, there is a
                     faster one for tree systems too, but it is harder to explain.)

                     cedures as in Section 5.3 to construct a feasible policy. The error bounds of Theorems
                     5.3.6 and 5.3.7 remain valid.
                          We now have all the pieces ofa complete approach to analyze nested systems. Because
                     an assembly system is naturally nested, this approach is entirely sufficient for that case.

                     5.4.7 Non-Nested Systems
                     For a distribution system or more generally a tree system, however, unless there is some
                     special reason to exclude non-nested policies, something more is needed. We illustrate
                     the idea with the three-item distribution system of Figure 5.4.5.

:sive procedure      decide which units go where in advance, at the instant they arrive, and keep the inventory
                     of item I in two separate stores, one destined for node 2 and the other for node 3. To keep
                     track of these inventories, imagine that we split node I into two artificial nodes, labeled 12
                     and 13, as in Figure 5.4.7. All item-I stock destined for node} is held at node lj,} = 1,2.
                     Call this the expanded network (Node I is still there, but it has an entirely new role, ex­
                     plained below. Notice, the expanded network is a tree system.)
                          Even the shipments from the source to node I can be divided in this way. So now,
                     conceptually, the source sends separate shipments to nodes 12 and 13. Since the rest of

                           It turns out that, in these terms, the policy should be nested. That is, a shipment to
                     node I} (i.e., a shipment of item I that includes uuits destined for node}) should trigger
                     a shipment from ljto} itself. (The argument is essentially the same as in Theorem 5.3.1.)

      item 1's echelon inventory is the sum of these quantities, i.e., 7 L = Tt2 + 713 = ~(A2UI2
      + A3UI3 ). (Problem 5.18 asks you to work out the details.) Thus, we can write the hold­
      ing cost for item 1 as 1I(g12uL2 + g13U13), where

                                 g'j   =   h'}_'j   Alj   =   Aj   hlj   =   hi
      This has the same fonn as the other holding-cost tenns in ceu).
           As for the fixed cost, we incur kl when a shipment arrives at node 12 or node 13 O£
      both. So, we cannot just set klj to k" for that would double-count the fixed cost when both
      nodes receive shipments. Instead, set klj = 0, but reintroduce node 1, as in Figure 5.4.7,
      with its original fixed cost k l . Interpret the expanded network as a nested system. So, an
      order for 12 or 13 or both triggers an order for I, and thus incurs the cost k l , as required.
      Thus, the average fixed cost remains kl/UI.AlSO, setAl = O. (The Aj and Alj above already
      account for the physical flows and holding costs.) Thus, the shipments to node I are only
      logical shipments of quantity zero.
           In sum, the (nested) expanded network is entirely equivalent to the original system.
      Its costs correctly measure the true costs, even for a non-nested policy.
           We are virtually done: Just apply the nested-system methods above, first to solve the
      relaxed problem, and then to round its solution. (Wbat about the peculiar data? Do they
      create problems? Fortunately, the answer is no. For instance, if item 1 were isolated in its
      own cluster, since g( {I}) = 0, the ratio 'IT( {I}) would be ill defined. It turns out that the
      algorithm never isolates item 1, so this problem never arises.) The result is a policy for
      the expanded system, which detennines a policy for the original system. The error­
      bound theorems remain valid. So, once again, the policy perfonns well, and C- accu­
      rately estimates the optimal cost.
           This approach extends to any tree system. The key step is the construction of an ex­
      panded network, with new items corresponding to certain (directed) paths in the original
      networ~ so that a policy in the original system corresponds to a nested policy in the ex­

                                     panded network. Then, apply the nested-system methodology to this expanded network.
                                     (Unfortunately, the expanded netwolk is not always a tree system; ifnot, its relaxed prob­
                                     lem requires a somewhat more complex algorithm than Procedure Tree_Relaxed.)
                                          The end result is a stationary-interval policy for the original system. If the policy
                                     happens to be non-nested however, the order quantities need not be stationary. In the ex­
                                     ample above, suppose ui = u t and u; = 2u t. Then, item I's batch sizes alternate be­

                                     nv-een A2 u + and A2 u + A3 u;. In general, the order quantities are periodic, though the
                                     pattern may be more intricate than simple alternation.

                                     5.4.8 Coordinatioll alld Sensitivity Revisited
                                     The basic principles of coordination here are thus the same as in a series system, de­
                                     scribed in Section 5.3.7: Synchronize ti,e items within each cluster, partially synchro­
                                     nize across clusters, and use stationary intervals for all clusters.
                                           Recall that, for a series system, a decentralized control mechanism coordinates the
                                     stages properly. The same idea, with minor variations, works here too. The simplest case
                                     is an assembly system. Each cluster itselflooks like a small-scale assembly system with
                                     a single end item. Only this last item holds inventory. To conununicate benv-een clusters,
+ I l3   =   Y2(A2 U 12              we need only direct each cluster to order when necessary from all its predecessor clus­
n write the hold­                    ters, and to send each outgoing order to the appropriate item in its successor cluster. Oth­
                                     erwise, each cluster operates its own EOQ-like policy.
                                           A tree system is more complex, especially in the non-nested case, where the order
                                     quantities need not be stationary. Even so, it is possible to construct a fairly simple, lo­
                                     cally controlled order rule that correctly implements the policy. (We omit the details.)

150   Foundations ofIrrventory Management


      locations could order separately, but it may be advantageous to pool their orders. This
      way, especially if the source is far away, we can consolidate the shipments over part of
      the distance and thus trim transportation costs. Likewise, we can centralize and sim­
      plify the administrative tasks of order processing. (And, if the supplier offers quantity
      discounts, joint purchasing exploits them better. This sort of scale economy is not the
      focus here, however.)
          In multiproduct systems, joint replenishment offers similar advantages. When the
      products are all supplied by the same source, we can save transportation charges, as
      above. In any case it may he simpler to process occasional orders, each including many
      products, than frequent single-product orders. In addition, when ordering means pro­
      duction, we can sometimes pool semp operations.
           In such situations the supply process offers economies of scope. Whereas scale
      economies enable us to order large quantities cheaply, economies of scope refer to a
      large number of diverse activities, in this case the orders for many items.
           Here is a model that captures this notion in a simple way: The fixed order cost now
      consists of two components. There is an item-specific cost kj , incurred by each order of
      item). as before. In addition, there a cost~, incurred on ordering any item or combina­
      tion of items. For instance, if we order item I alone, the total fixed cost is ko + k j • If we
      order items I and 2 together, the total is ko + kj + k2 (not 2ko + k j + ~). In a produc­
      tion setting. ko is called a major setup cost, and the other '9 minor setup costs. (This
      wording suggests that ko is larger than the other '9, but no such assumption is required.)
      This model is called the joint-replenishment problem. For the moment assume all lead­
      times are zero. (We discuss positive leadtimes later on.)
           To exploit the economies of scope to the fullest extent, we can choose to order all
      the items together. In this case every item uses the same order interval, say u. Define
                                            k ~   ko + "L;~j '9
                                            gj ~ h)\j

                                            g -   ""J=lgj

      Given u, the overall average cost is qu) = klu + Xgu. This is just the cost function of a
      single-item EOQ model! Thus, the best order interval u· can be computed in the usual way.
           This need not be the best approach, however. There are disadvantages to joint re­
      plenishment. By forcing all items to confonn to a common order interval, we give up the
      flexibility to optimize each one individually. (If ko is tiny compared to the other k;,
      clearly, joint ordering makes little sense.) A less rigid approach would be better, one
      which recognizes both the advantages and the disadvantages of synchronization.
           One reasonable approach is to partition the items into groups. Each group contains
      similar items, as measured by the ratios ~;lSj' Then, order each group's items together, as
      above, but manage each group independently of the others. This approach retains flexi­
      bility between groups, while exploiting economies of scope within groups. (It is not that
      hard to determine the best partition. Interestingly, the calculation is much like the algo­
      rithm for solving the DEL model of Chapter 4.)
           This approach can miss clear cost-saving opportunities, however. For example, sup­
      pose that it constructs two groups, and the second group's order interval is precisely 2.01
                      Chapter 5   Several Products and Locations                                               151

      with the larger group, since their intervals are positive-integer multiples of u + (0).


      5.5.3 Complex Economies ofScope
      The joint-replenishment problem embodies the simplest form of economy of scope. Far
      more intricate forms are encountered in practice. For example, suppose the items repre­
      sent products. There are several suppliers, each the sole source for a family of products.
      There are transportation economies ofscope within each supplier's family, but not across
      suppliers. Also, the products have different physical characteristics; some are fragile,
      some refrigerated, some are both, and some neither. On receipt of an order, each type re­
      quires special handling, perhaps with special equipment; there are common setup activ­
      ities for fragile items and other activities for refrigerated ones. Consequently, there are
      economies of scope over items of the same type. Each supplier's family may include
      fragile and nonfragile items, refrigerated and nomefrigerated.
            In such situations the fixed cost of an order has many components. For each sup­
      plier, there is a cost when any item or combination of items in its family is ordered; there
      is a cost to order one or more fragile items and a different cost for refrigerated items;
      there are item-specific costs as well. In general, the total fixed cost depends in a com­
      plex way on the subset of items included. That is, the fixed cost is some fimction k{M),
      where M is any subset of items.
            The approach above for the basic joint-replenishment problem can be extended to ac­
      commodate virtually any plausible fixed-cost fimctionl That is, the problem can be solved
      by the methods developed earlier for supply-demand networks. (Which fimctions are
      plausible? The condition is a technical one: k{M) must be increasing and submodular. If
      you don't know what that means, never mind; the example above does satisfy the condi­
      tion. To deal with such k{M), the techniques ofSections 5.3 and 5.4 must be revised some­
      what, but the essential ideas remain the same, and the key results remain valid.)
            Moreover, consider a system with supply-demand relationships and economies of
      scope. Examples include an assembly system whose raw materials (items with no pred­
                    Chapter 5   Several Products and Locations                                                 153

                    ecessors) all come from a single source, and a tree system with certain products sharing
                    setup operations. The same general approach applies even here! (Alas, we haven't room
                    to cover the details.)


                    5.5.4 The Inventory-Routing Problem
                    Again consider a multilocation system: A single source supplies one product to several
                    locations. The joint-replenishment problem corresponds to a two-step transportation
                    scenario. Here is an alternative scenario:
                         There is a single vehicle, say a truck. When the locations place orders, the truck
                    picks them up at the source and delivers them to their designated locations. The truck
                    need not return to a central point between visits to successive locations. Rather, the truck
                    follows some route among them. (Since the truck must return to the source for later or­
                    ders, it may as well park at the source between deliveries. So, the route starts and ends
m: Items j ,; j*    at the source. For simplicity, imagine that the entire delivery process takes negligible

,ofu+(O).                Suppose all locations use the same order interval 11, and all order together. Thus, the
                    route passes through all locations, including the source. To model the corresponding
                    costs, define

                    not to force all locations to order at the same frequency. Here, though, it is more diffi­
extended to ac­      cult to balance the pluses and minuses of synchronization.

154        Foundations ofInventory Management


                This approach has no simple performance guarantees like the theorems of Sec­
           tion 5.3. On the other hand, it performs well when the nnmber of locations is large.
           (Technically speaking, it is "asymptotically optimal" as J grows.) Also, it has been ex­
           tensively tested, and it seems to work well.
                The same model describes a multiproduct system, where the sctup costs depend on
           the production sequence. We explore a similar model in the next section.


5.6 Shared Production Capacity: Economic Lot Scheduling
           5.6.1 Average Resource Usage
           Now, suppose the items share a common production resource of limited capacity. Actu­
           ally, there are several different ways to model shared production capacity. We begin with
           a simple onc.
                 Reconsider the independent-item system of Section 5.2, where the EOQ model de­
           scribes each item. Suppose the quantity wO now measures the aggregate average usage
           of a limited production resource. Further, suppose we can express the capacity limit as
           a bound on average usage. That is, we let wO denote the capacity itself:

                                                ~j w{;)       0;   wO                          (5.6.1)
                                                          J

           The remaining problem is to minimize the aggregate inventory investment, cl. Clearly,
           the constraint (5.6.1) is always binding, so we can replace it by the equation

                                                ~.w-(~)
                                                 'j  qj
                                                      J
                                                        =          wO

                This problem is the reverse ofproblem (5.2.2), which minimizes wO subject to a con­
           straint on cI. As discussed in that context, these two problems are essentially equivalent­
           they generate the sarne tradeoff curve. Moreover, this new problem, like (5.2.2), can be
           solved by selecting appropriate aggregate costs K and 'fI, using them to compute item costs
           ~ and hi' and then solving a separate EOQ model for each item.
                The same idea can be applied to supply/demand networks. Consider a series system.
           Orders for all stages draw on a common resource, constrained by (5.6.1) as above. Here
           is the approach in rough outline: Choose K and 'fI, form the kj and hj accordingly, and
           then solve the uncapacitated series system as in Section 5.3. Adjust K and 11, repeating
           this process until the constraint (5.6.1) is just barely satisfied.


           5.6.2 The Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (ELSP)
           For some purposes in some situations, it suffices to limit the average resource usage as
           above, ignoring the time pattern of usage. This is so, for instance, in preliminary system­
           design studies. Real capacities, however, impose more stringent constraints. The actual
           usage must respect capacity limits at every point in time.
                Suppose the items are products, each described by the EOQ model with a finite pro­
           duction rate, as in Section 3.4. The production resource consists of a single machine,

                         The simplest approach is a cyclic schedule: Produce the products in some fixed se­

      the run length is precisely P,u, and the average inventory is ~ ~ 15(1 - p)"-;u. The total

      common-cycle approach to the joint-replenishment problem, notwithstanding the radi­
      cally different characters ofthe two problems.
           The rotation-schedule approach certainly is simple, but as in the joint-replenishment
      problem, there are disadvantages to imposing a common cycle time on all products. Let
      uj ~ (2A/gi 12 betbe optimal cycle time for product} alone, ignoring tbe others. When the
      uj are very different, the products' individual economics favor producing some more fre­
      quently than others.

      Here, u* = (2-99.0717.0)'; = 5.32. The cost of this solution is C(u*) = 37.24.
            Notice that u5 and II~ are nearly the same, but ut is about halfofthose values. These data sug­
      gest producing product 1 twice as often as the others.
            Unlike the joint-replenishment problem, the ELSP does not reduce to a simple
      network-type model. It appears to be fundamentally more difficult. There is a fairly simple heuris­
      tic. Here is the basic idea:

           1.	 Compute the uj.
           2. Use the ,,-"within a rounding procedure like that of Section 5.3 to determine the
              products' relative production frequencies. That is, treat each product as its own cluster,
              compute the II +( )), set u ++ = maXj {It +())}, and ROFj = U ++ /u +(j). Then, ROFj is

                     The setup costs in the basic ELSP are independent ofthe production sequence. Suppose
                     instead that there is a changeover cost k~; to switch from product i to product}. Also, there
                     is a cost ko} to start producing} when the machine is idle, and a cost kjo to turn the ma­

y simple heuris­     ries system: There are several products and several production stages. The stages are
                     arranged in a fixed sequence, and every product requires processing at each ofthe stages
                     in that order. At each stage there is one machine, capable of processing only one prod­

               Thus, this model adds realistic capacity constraints to the series systems of Sec­
          tion 5.3. Research on this type of model has only just begun. Preliminary results suggest
          that a simple heuristic, related to the one above for the ELSP, works quite well.


5.7 Time-Varying Demand
          Every model in this chapter is driven by one or more demand rates. In many practical in­
          stances, those demand rates change over time, for the same reasons and in the same ways
          as in Chapter 4. This section explores a few of the possibilities.
               First.. we explore some simple cases, in the spirit of Section 4.2. Then we turn to dis­
          crete-time formulations, analogous to the DEL model of Section 4.3. Keep your expec­
          tations modest: These formulations are important to know but hard to solve. Researchers
          have devised heuristic approaches for some of these models; refer to the Notes.


          5.7.1 Supply-Demand Networks: Extreme Cases
          [n certain extreme cases, like those of Section 4.2, it is possible to sketch what a good
          policy looks like and how the system works. Again, the reasoning is entirely heuristic.
                Consider the series system of Section 5.3, but suppose its demand rate is A(t), a
          function of time. Recall, in the constant-demand case, the optimal partition N* is insen­
          sitive to the demand rate. It is reasonable, therefore, to use the same partition for the
          variable-demand system. That is, all the items in each cluster N m always order together.
                First, suppose the changes in A(t) are small andlor fast. Then, as in Section 4.2, it
          makes sense to ignore the demand fluctuations. That is, use constant order intervals
          u+(m), or alternatively constant order quantities Au+(m), based on the average demand
          rate A.
               Next, suppose that A(t) changes slowly. Then, a policy should focus on the current
          rate A(t), ignoring long-run changes. There are several plausible ways to implement this
          idea. Here is one: Use a nested., zero-inventory policy. Recompute all the order intervals
          u + (m) each time cluster N, must order, applying the methods of Section 5.3, treating the
          current demand rate A(t) as constant. Use these u+(m) until the next time cluster N j or­
          ders. Within each such cycle, adjust the order quantities to retain feasibility, given the
          actual changes in A(t). (Alternatively, use the stationary quantities A(t)u+(m) until clus­
          ter N] must order again.)
               These ideas extend directly to a tree system whose demand rates Aj(t) change with
          time. [f the changes are small and/or fast, again ignore them. Slow-changing demands
          require a bit more care: Suppose some common factor drives all the rates; that is, for
          some function A(t) and constant base rates AJ: Aj(t) ~ A(t)A~'. When A(t) = A, remem­
          ber, the optimal partition N* is insensitive to A. So, again it is reasonable to fix N*. Then,
          apply the approach above for series systems.


          5.7.2 Supply-Demand Networks: Discrete-Time Formulation
          5.7.2.1 Formulation

          Consider a supply-demand network like that of Section 5.4, where time is now discrete,

          as in Section 4.3. We shall formulate a multi-item analogue of the DEL model.

                          The notation closely follows that of Section 4.3, but subscripts i andj distinguish
                     the items. The model data are the following:

      This model is a linear rnixed-integer program.
            Ittums out that the optimal solution enjoys the zero-inventory property. Can one use this
      fact to construct a simple method to solve the problem? In general, alas, the answer is no.
            To obtain a fully or nearly optimal solution requires the methodology of mixed­
      integer programming. Among the tools of that trade are techniques to exploit special
      structure, and the model has a great deal of that. Such techniques do help. Still, the cur­
      rent state of the art allows us to solve only fairly small problems.
            Several heuristic methods are available. Section 5.8 discusses an important one, the
      MRP heuristic, and the Notes mention others. Roundy's [1993] approach is especially
      interesting, for it builds on methods for the stationary models of Sections 5.3 and 54.
      Assume stationary costs. The heuristic constructs the optimal partition N* for the
      stationary-demand case. and in the nonstationary-demand problem, it forces the items
      within each cluster to order together, as in Section 5.7.1 above. This step reduces the
      scale of model (5.7.1) to (5.7.4); essentially, it now represents clusters instead of items.
      Then. the heuristic constructs a related system where the clusters are arranged in series.
      Finally, it applies the algorithm below in Section 5.7.2.2 to solve this series system.
      Roundy proves that the cost of the solution is at most 44% above optimal; his numerical
      examples suggest that its performance is often much better than that.
            There are other ways to use information fi:om stationary models. We mentioned near
      the end of Section 5.34 that the solution of the relaxed problem can be interpreted as a
      cost-reallocation scheme, using the parameters 8j. That discussion focused on series sys­
      tems, but the same idea applies to general systems. These 6j capture the interactions be­
      tween items in a stationary system. The idea is to use these 8jto revise the cost coefficients
      of the nonstationary problem, and then to ignore the item interactions expressed in the dy­
      namics (5.7.2) (or to apply the MRP heuristic, which ignores some of those interactions).
      See B1ackbum and Millen [1982] and Rosling [1993] for elaborations of this notion.

      5,7,2,2 Series Systems
      There is a streamlined algorithm for series systems. The procedure requires O(Jr) time.
      There is an even simpler method, requiring only O(JT3 ) time, for nested series systems,
      which we present here. (The system is indeed nested, provided the cost factors satisfy
      cettain plausible conditions. See Problem 5.24.)
           Here is the basic idea: For eachj, compute arc costs kilt, u)just as in fommla (4.3.8)
      in Chapter 4, using the echelon holding costs h.(t) = h;(t) - h:_1(t) and echelon cumu­
      lative demands Di[t, u) ~ DAt, u). Define
              ¥f(s, t) =	 optimal cost of the system comprising stages j through J, starting at
                          time s and ending with horizon t, 0 :::; s < t :::; T
      These quantities can be computed recursively, starting with j =--= J and working backward:
      Set VJ+1(s, t) ~ O. Given ¥f+l(S, t), define the augmented arc costs
                                            k;[t, u) = kAt, u)   +   ¥f+l(t. u)

                         Construct the network ofFigure 4.3.1 using these arc costs. Then, for every pair of nodes

      feasible quantity, and so itselfis a constant. Thus, the extra term in Cj(t) does not affect the
      solution, and hence can be omitted.)
           There is another, simpler approach for tree systems: Just shift the time axis for each
      item, as in Section 5.4. In the two-stage series system above, for instance, interpret xz(t)
      and z2(t) as before, but reinterpretxi(t) as inventory at time t - L,'z + I and ZI (t) as pro­
      duction of item 1 completed just before time t - L,'z + 2. Under this relabeling scheme,
      the original dynamics (5.7.2) remains valid. [As in Section 5.4, this idea does /lot work
      for a general system, unless the Ieadtimes happen to be balanced; the general case re­
      quires (5.7.2') in place of (5.7.2), as above.]


      5. 7.3 Limited Capacity
      Consider a multiproduct system, whose products share a production facility of limited

                                So, for each i, there is only one positive air; all the others are zero. Now, were it not for
                                the supply-demand relationships embodied in the dynamics (5.7.2), the model would

nward of item i                 it is worth seeing that even such intricate systems can be represented in the language of
                                mixed-integer linear programming. We learn something about how things work in the act of
                                formulation itself. When J, R, and T are small, one can indeed obtain the solution-with a
                                powerful computer and some patience. Otherwise, one must use a heuristic method.
                                      One heuristic approach for this model (and other intricate, large-scale problems)
          (5.76)                is called hierarchical planning, which determines a solution in two steps. First, it
                                solves a relatively simple approximate model, called the aggregate model. This model
                                suppresses the fixed costs ki(t) and aggregates the items into groups. The second step,
.. ,J (5.7.7)                   called disaggregation, translates the aggregate model's solution into a solution of the
                                original model. It solves a separate model for each group, which divides the group's
                                production quantities among its original items.
                                      It is worth mentioning that all the difficulties here are caused by the fixed-cost
                                terms. Ifthe I<:,(t) = 0, the model becomes a linear program (LP); it is a large and intri­
                                cate Lp, but even those are easy to solve. (Hierarchical planning exploits this fact in its
                                aggregate model.) Such models are used widely to plan production and distribution. If
         (5.7.8)                the ki(t) are positive but small, moreover, the model is easier to work with than it would
                                be otherwise; exact methods work faster, and heuristics perform better. So, reducing the
         (5.7.9)                fixed costs simplifies analysis, in addition to its direct benefits.

      specific set of procedures underlying it. MRP is the de facto standard approach to pro­
      duction planning and control in the United States, and it is widely used elsewhere too;
      the number of companies using it runs easily into the hundreds of thousands.
            Our aim in this section is not to give a comprehensive account of:MRP. That would
      be impossible. MRP is virtually a managerial subculture with its own extensive vocabu­
      lary. A small but thriving industry provides MRP software and consulting services; a re­
      cent directory (APleS [1994]) lists 107 vendors. Rather, we offer a brief overview and
      assessment of MRP, focusing on its basic logic and its relation to other approaches.


      5.8.2 The Core Model and the Heuristic
      MRP is not usually presented as a model-based approach. But there is a model at the core
      of MRP. To understand MRP, it is crucial to understand the model and what MRP does
      with it. That model is precisely (5.7.1) to (5.7.4) above, with (5.7.2') replacing (5.7.2).
      In words, the world as viewed by MRP consists of a set of items N, linked by a network
      (N, A) to form a general system with leadtimes, operating in discrete time.
           Let us repeat the core model for easy reference:

      Initial conditions:
                                             x;(O) = x;o         i = 1, ... , J                         (5.7.1)
      Dynamics:
            x;(t   + 1)   CC   x;(t)   + z,(I)   - d;(t)   -lj<s",(,)Zj   (I   + Lij -     I)
                                                  t = 0, ... , T - 1, i       =    1, ... , J           (5.7.2')
      Constraints:

                                  x;(t) "" 0         t = 1, ... , T, i    =       1, ... ,J             (5.7.3)

                                  =;(1) "" 0         t=O, ... ,T-l,i= 1, ... ,J
      Objective:
                   Minimize              l, l;';-r; [k,(t)8(z,(t») + c,(t)z,(I)] + l, l;~L h;(t)x;(t)   (5.7.4)
      (There are additional initial conditions, fixing previously detennined zJt) to constants,
      as discussed in Section 5.7.2.3. Other variations are discussed below.)
            MRP's scheduling procedures essentially constitute a heuristic solutiou method for
      this model. In broad tenus this is a decomposition technique. It constructs a solution for
      one item at a time, beginning with downstream items and gradually working upstream.
            To describe the method in detail, recall we number the items so that i < j whenever
      (i. j) EA. With this understanding, MRP treats the items in reverse numerical order.
            Thus, MRP starts with item J Now, item Jhas no successors; the summation in the
      dynamics (5.7.2') for j = J disappears. Item J does interact with other items, but only
      through their dynamics. MRP ignores these interactions. What remains, then, is a single­
      item DEL model, which MRP solves to determine a solution for item J (To solve this
      DEL model, some versions of MRP use an exact method, such as Algorithm
                    Chapter 5   Several Products and Locations                                                          165

                    The dynamics (5.7.2') then become

                    Again, MRP uses these dynamics within a DEL model to determine z?(t). Thus, at each
         (5.7.1)
                    step, the order quantities for downstream items become additional demands.
                         Clearly, the overall procedure takes little time, and the end result is a feasible solu­
                    tion of the core model. That is no small accomplishment, in view of the complexity of
                    the model.
        (5.7.2')         It is interesting to compare this heuristic with the exact algorithm for series systems
                    outlined in Section 5.7.2. That method too starts downstream and works upstream. But,
                    it works harder at each stage to compute the function J!j (s, t) for all pairs (s. f). Clearly,
         (5.7.3)    MRP loses infonnation as it progresses from stage to stage.
                         The MRP heuristic is a plausible one, but there is little evidence concerning its
                    performance in solving the core model. (Several alternatives have been proposed, as
                    mentioned in Section 5.7.2.1 above and the Notes below, but to our knowledge none

      and the model. The resulting d;(t) are output targets, collectively called the master pro­
      duction schedule (MPS). There seems to be no uniform methodology for master pro­
      duction scheduling; this activity employs a variety of techniques. some fannal, others
      informal. Still, the MPS embodies several important functions. Notably, it must plan for
      capacity limits, which do not appear in the core model (a point revisited below).
            Another crucial layer is buffering. The core model includes no uncertainties in de­
      mand and supply, but such uncertainties do exist. Buffering refers to adjustments of the
      core model's data to account for uncertainties. There are two main buffering techniques,
      safety stock and safety time: Safety stock in this context means revising the lower
      bounds on the x;(t) in (5.7.3) from 0 to positive values Xi-(t), as discussed in Sec­
      tion 4.3.7. As mentioned there, it is hard to choose appropriate safety stocks even for the
      DEL model, and it is still harder here. Safety time means revising the L; and Lij. upward.
      This too is hard, as explained below.
            Still further out from the core, many MRP systems provide support for other activ­
      ities besides production scheduling. Indeed, it is common to find all the finn's control
      and data-processing functions, including procurement, accounts payable and payroll,
      built around MRP
            Partly for this reason, some MRP systems, especially older ones, are slow and clumsy
      to work with. Other neVt'cr systems dispense with these extras, concentrating instead on ef­
      ficient implementation of the core-model heuristic above. This approach is called rapid
      MRP, and indeed it is much faster than the traditional, full-featured MRP systems.
           Enterprise resource planning (ERP) extends MRP's logic to the entire finn, encom­
      passing multiple production and distribution facilities. Some versions are even capable of
      linking the activities of several finns, using modern communications teclmologies.


      5.8.4 EvaluatiOl': MRP versus OPT and JIT
      People have strong feelings about MRP. Some view it as a blessing, others a curse. (In
      its early days, ~1RP's proponents shamelessly oversold it; the harsher negative views
      heard today, no doubt, reflect reactions to that earlier hyperbole.) Let us briefly review
      some of its key strengths and weaknesses from a broad managerial point of view:
            MRP's primary strength is so obvious that it is easily missed. As explained in Sec­
      tion 5.1, complex production and distribution systems can be represented as networks.
      This idea is quite natural, once you see it. However, MRP was the first approach to em­
      body this idea within practical, widely accessible software. Thus, MRP provided the first
      systematic procedures to coordinate large numbers of items with complex supply/de­
      mand relationships. This simple fact explains much of MRP's popularity.
            One major weakness of MRP is the lack of capacity limits in its core model. Of
      course, real resource capacities are limited, so the heuristic solution may well be infea­
      sible. To compensate, something must be done outside the core model. Several alterna­
      tives are employed in practice:
            Some users add safety times; that is, they inflate the leadtimes Li and L;; to include
      anticipated delays due to congested resources. This cure: unfortunately, is often worse
      than the disease. Capacity limits hardly ever induce constant delays of this sort. The re­
      sult, typically, is that many orders arrive well before they are expected, thus generating
                       Chapter 5   Several Products and Locations                                                  167

 the master pro­        excessive inventories. Even so, occasionally there is more congestion than the Li and L;j
 for master pro­        account for, so the approach falis to meet the output targets of the MPS. (It is possible

  below).                    Many MRP programs include a module called capacity requirements planning (CRP).
::-rtainties in de­     CRP is a reporting function. After the MRP's heuristic is run, CRP computes and reports
ostments of the        the solution's usage of key resources, higWighting those whose capacities are violated. At
ing techniques,        that point, some manual intervention is necessary, e.g., fix parts of the solution =f(t) to
sing the lower          force feasibility, or adjust the MPS (the d;(t)). Then, rerun the heuristic. Of course, there is
cussed in Sec­         no guarantee that the revised solution is feasible; several iterations may be necessary.
oks even for the             Newer MRP programs provide support for this iterative CRP process, along with

                        OPT's heuristic identifies one or a few bottlenecks, resources whose capacity limits are
                       most severely strained. Then, to construct a solution, it aims to utilize the bottleneck

168     Foundafiom' a/Inventory Management


        et cetera. MRP is a demanding and fairly rigid planning discipline, and it does not easily
        forgive such errors.
             Also, as a managerial approach, centralized control is awkward: Generally, it entails
        substantial overhead costs (in the form ofa substantial bureaucracy). People on the shop
        floor and in the warehouse often experience MRP as a distant, arbitrary master. They
        find little opportunity or motivation to take initiative, either to facilitate MRP itself (e.g.,
        by reporting problematic conditions), or to improve the actual physical processes.
              From this perspective it is easy to appreciate the appeal of a quite different philos­
        ophy, the just-in-time (ITT) approach. One central tenet of ITT is to decentralize control
        as much as possible. Here, demand pulls stock from downstream stages, which in turn
        pull stock from upstream stages, with minimal central direction; in contrast. MRP
        pushes stock through the system via the MPS and the core-model heuristic. Partly in this
        way, but also in others, flT encourages process improvement, through small-scale ini­
        tiatives as well as large-scale projects. (The ITT approach is discussed further in Sec­
        tion 88. Caveat. ITT's hyperbole exceeds even MRP's and OPT's.)
              Different as their underlying philosophies are, it is nonetheless possible to integrate
        MRP and JlT, or at least parts ofthem. Certainly, there is nothing to stop a company from
        encouraging process improvements while adhering to MRP Even at the level of control,
        MRP can be used to set longer-term output targets, leaving day-to-day or hour-to-hour
        control to HI. Alternatively, one can relax central control within certain groups of re­
        lated stages, but centrally control the flow of goods between groups. These by no means
        exhaust the possibilities: there are many others.
              This brings us to a final and perhaps decisive issue-adaptability. On this score,
        MRP has a mixed record. The MRP industry has been less than eager to listen to ideas
        from elsewhere in the operations-management community. This was especially true in
        earlier years, but it remains so to some extent. One well-informed observer (Wagner
        [1993]) writes, "MRP has become a stern gatekeeper that guards the plant floor from in­
        cursions by operations research." In my view, this insularity has cost the MRP commu­
        nity dearly. Had it been more open to alternative formulations, solution techniques, and
        control mechanisms, MRP would surely be a more capable discipline today, and fewer
        people would regard it as a rigid monolith.
              On the other hand, MRP has shown considerable adaptability in certain key directions.
        In extending the approach to MRP II and ERP, and incorporating elements of ITT, the in­
        dustry has responded creatively to real needs of its customers. Based on that experience,
        some of its practitioners envision MRP becoming a flexible approach. capable of digest­
        ing a variety of new methods and ideas. That would be a welcome development indeed.

Problems

5.1	 Verify that the variety index J. satisfies (5.2.1); i.e., I <; J. <; J. (Hint: Define xj = Wjc)'-j' Think of
     the X:i as variables in an appropriate optimization problem,)
5.2 Carry out the steps outlined in the text to solve the optimization problem (5.2.2). Use the solution to

5.3 Consider an independent-item system with a very large number J of items. It may be difficult to
     obtain all the individual-item data. This problem suggests a statistical approach to estimating J•.
          First, it is often true that the Wj are similar across}. For simplicity, assume that they are equal
     (to w). Second, a useful empirical relationship has been observed in many multi-item inventories:
     The frequency distribution of the expenditure rates l.:jAj over the items is approximately lognormal.
                                                                                                               Y
     (If Y is a random variable having the normal distribution with mean iL and variance (]'2, then X = e
     has a lognormal distribution with these same two parameters.) Assume that J is so large, the items

     interval (x, x + dx) is/ex) dx, where/ex) is the lognormal probability density function (pdf) with
     parameters J.1 and 0'2. Also, assume we have estimates of!J- and O'~.
          For any positive number E, E[X€J = exp (E!J- + YzE 2 (f2). For instance, in the notation of
     Section 5.2, CAll ~ E[X] = exp (fJ- + "<T 2 ). Show that, under these assumptions, J. ~ J. oxp
     (_~~O'2), Explain why it makes sense intuitively that J. decreases in (f2.
5.4	 Consider the multi-item inventory of Section 5.2, but now suppose that platmed backorders are
     allowed. Define a third aggregate perfonnance measure,

                                             eB   ~   aggregate cost-value of backorders

                                                  =   !jc}3j
      where Bj is the average backorders for item j. (Actually, a more relevant measure is pB, defined by
      using the sales price p) instead of cj to weight Rj . This case is more complex. Assume for now that
      the markup ratio p;lc} is the same for all items, so cB expresses the same information as pB.)
          Show that the three measures are connected by the following functional relationship:
                                                                  I

     This equation describes a two-dimensional surface in the three-space with coordinates (cl, cB.
     wO), analogous to the tradeoff curve of Section 5.2. It is sometimes called the aggregate tradeoff
     surface.
          Now, drop the assumption above, that the markup ratio pic} is constant, and use pB instead of
     cB. There is no simple fonnula for the tradeoff surface in this case, but one can still generate the
     surface numerically: Let ~ denote the cost factor for aggregate backorders, analogous to K and 'f),
     and w ~ [3/([3 + '1). Derive formulas for cI, cB, and \VO in terms of the cost ratios '1/K and w.
     Describe how to use these formulas to calculate points on the tradeoff surface.

5.17 Consider the distribution system of Figure 5.4.2. Suppose it describes a production process.
     Originally, all items are measured in kilograms (kg). To make I kg of end item 6 requires 4 kg of

     2 kg of item I, and item 2 uses 0.25 kg of item 1. Revise the items' quantity units, so that each item
     uses precisely one Wlit of its (single) predecessor. (Continue to measure item I, the raw material,
     in kg.) lfthe original demand rates are

6.1 Introduction
           6.1.1 Major Themes
           This chapter addresses some of the truly basic issues of operations management: How
           should we control a system whose demand is uncertain? What are the effects of such un­
           certainties on system performance?
                Here, we explore these issues for an otherwise simple system; there is only one item,
           the supply process generates constant leadtimes and perfect quality, and demand is sta­
           tionary. Subsequent chapters study more complex systems with stochastic leadtimes and
           imperfect quality (Chapter 7). multiple items (Chapter 8), and time-varying demand
           (Chapter 9). Also, this chapter assumes that stockouts are backlogged; Chapter 7 treats
           the lost-sales case.
                Stochastic demand, in combination with an order leadtime, raises altogether new
           difficulties: As a result of the leadtime, there is a delay between the actions we take and
           their actual effects. Such lags raise no problems if demand is ce11ain. as we have seen,
           for then we know what will happen during the lead time, and we can adjust our current

                                                                                                  175
176   Foundations ofIllventOl)l Management


      actions to compensate. Likewise, in the extreme (and rare) case of zero leadtirne, even
      with random demands, we retain full control of the system. Here, this is no longer true;
      we must act in the dark, unable to foresee the ultimate effects of our actions. In particu­
      lar, no matter what we do, an unexpected surge in demand can exhaust our stock, leav­
      ing us unable to meet subsequent demands; some degree of stockout risk is inevitable.
            Generally, longer leadtimes and greater demand uncertainty both degrade the pre­
      cision with which we can control the system. And the less precise the control is, the more
      inventory we need to serve customers adequately. The primary goal of this chapter is to
      probe and elaborate this intuitive insight, to understand precisely how these combined
      effects work.
            One m,\jor conclusion is that the primary impact of these factors can be captured by
      a single summary measure, denoted CT. the standard deviation ofleadtime demand. We
      shall explain what this means in due course. For now, think of (T as an index of impreci­
      sion, a measure of the noise or variation that impedes our efforts to control the system.
      (The next chapter shows that 0' also captures the effect of leadtime uncertainty.) Along
      with other parameters examined earlier, such as the demand rate and the fixed order cost,
      IT is a major determinant of performance. Anything we can do to reduce it-and there

      are typically several ways-will improve the system.
            On the other hand, reducing variation takes patient effort, and it is virtually never
      possible to eliminate it entirely. These simple facts are widely unappreciated: Too many
      firms proudly promulgate policies mandating perfect customer service and zero inven­
      tories, while neglecting to mobilize the resources needed to confront variation in a seri­
      ous way. These are pieties, not policies. Our aim must be to manage stockout risk, and
      to do this intelligently we must understand its underlying sources.


      6.1.2     Summary
      Here is a brief overview of what lies ahead: Throughout the chapter we model time as
      continuous, but demand, inventory, and other quantities as discrete (integer-valued). We
      pose several models of demand and supply. In each case we specify a plausible type of
      control policy.
           The initial goal is performance evaluation, to calculate the key measures of per­
      formance for any policy in the specified class. Sometimes we obtain exact formulas,
      but we also develop useful approximations. We explore some ofthe properties of these
      formulas, to learn how performance responds to alternative controls and to changes in
      the model parameters. This mode of analysis takes up Sections 6.2 to 6.4 and much of
      Sections 6.6 and 6.7.
           Later (in Section 6.5 and parts of Sections 6.6 and 6.7), we introduce cost factors.
      define an overall cost function, and show how to determine the best policy (within a
      given class). Because the models here are so complex, we cannot always express the op­
      timal solution in closed form. We do obtain such formulas for certain special cases and
      approximations. Otherwise, we show how to compute the optimal policy by fairly sim­
      ple numerical methods. Even without closed-form formulas, moreover! we learn a good
      deal about the qualitative behavior of the optimal policy and its performance. It is here
      that we see most clearly the impact of the variation index (j.

178        Foundations ofInventory Management

           need an information system capable of tracking the inventory position, which requires
           recording demands as they occur. These are sometimes called transaction reporting
           systems. (Such systems are fairly common now, because of the advent of electronic
           point-of-sale terminals and related communication technologies.) Section 6.7.3 briefly
           discusses a periodic-review policy, where orders are placed at regular intervals. Chap­
           ter 9 treats discrete-time models, in which a regular grid of possible order times is im­
           posed on the problem from the beginning.
                Most of the chapter, assuming demands occur one unit at a time, focuses on the
           order-quantitylreorder-point policy, or (r, q) policy, introduced in Section 3.3. An im­
           portant special case is the base-stock policy, where q = 1.
                For the lumpy-demand case (Section 6.6), we consider two plausible extensions of
           the (r, q) policies. The first, also called an (r, q) policy, orders integer multiples of q. The
           second, called an (I; s) policy, orders enough to raise the inventory position to a fixed tar­
           get level s. Also, Section 6.7.2 explores a more elaborate policy for world-driven
           demand, which bases order decisions on information about the world.


6.2 Policy Evaluation: Poisson Demand
           6.2.1 Preliminaries
           This section shows how to compute performance measures for a given policy. Through­
           out, demand is a Poisson process. This subsection sets forth some basic notation and
           technical preliminaries. The next two subsections present the main results; Section 6.2.2
           focuses on the special case of a base-stock policy, while Section 6.2.3 treats the general
           (,; q) policy. Section 6.2.4 discusses customer waiting times. All proofs are colIected in
           Section 6.2.5.

                           This implies that D(I) has the Poisson distribution with mean At. that is,
                                                                           (At)de-A<

                      Also, D(I, u] has the Poisson distribution with mean A(U - I), which depends on the inter­
                      val (I. u] only through its length, not its location. Finally, D(I) and D(I, u] are independent.
                      (In technical terms. D has stationary, independent increments. See Section C.2.3.4 and
                      Section C.5.6 in Appendix C for more about Poisson distributions and processes.)
                            Figure 6.2.1 illustrates (among other things) some demands generated by a Poisson
                      process. The demands are quite irregular; in several places, they seem to occur in
                      bunches, and there are long gaps with no demands at all. This behavior is typical.
                           A Poisson process is widely used to model demand for several reasons: It is easy to
<val (0, I]
                      specify; the rate A is its only parameter. In many practical situations. moreover, the
                      model is fairly accurate; demand really does behave like a Poisson process. (One reason
                      is that demand often comes from many small, nearly independent sources, e.g., cus­
                      tomers spread over a large region, and a Poisson process approximates such an aggre­
the collection        gate process reasonably well.) Finally, the mathematical simplicity of this model
                      smooths the tasks of analysis and calculation.

          Given a fixed policy. several state variables describe the evolution of the system over
      time. For each time t ~ 0,
                              I(t)        = inventory on hand

                              B(t) = backorders outstanding
                              IN(t)       = net inventory = I(t)   - B(t)
                              A(t) = stockout indicator = l{IN(t)             <;     OJ
                              IO(t) = inventory on order
                              IP(t)       = inventory position = IN(t) + !OCt)
      Each ofthese quantities is a random variable. To indicate a quantity over all t we use bold
      letters, like D above, for example, 1 ~ {I(t) : t:2: OJ. This is a stochastic process, as are
      B, IN, etc. The net inventory IN(t) determines the stockout indicator A(t), as above, and
      also both the inventory and backorders by
                                     I(t)   = [IN(t)]+       B(t) = [IN(tW
           The perfonnance measures of primary interest are the same as in Section 3.3:
                                      A      = average stockout frequency

                                      13     = average backorders

                                      I      = average inventory

                                      OF = average order frequency.
      These are long-run averages, e.g.,

                                            7=   limT~ro {(~)S6" I(t) dtj
      But it is not obvious that this limit exists or how to compute it. Fortunately, under the as­
      sumptions above, it turns out that I is well-behaved in two important senses: First, I is
      ergodic. The precise technical meaning ofthis property is not important here, but it im­
      plies that the limit above does exist (with probability I). Indeed, it implies that I has a
      long-run frequency distribution; i.e., for every integer i, the followiug limit exists (with
      probability I):

                                gI(i)
                                 -
                                            ~ limT~ro [(1')S6"
                                                       IT
                                                               1 {I(t) =    ij dt]

      I denotes a random variable with this distribution; then, 7 = E[l]. Second, I has a limit­
      ing distribution. This means that the probability distributions ofthe random variables I(t)
      converge to a limit as t ----t co, and this limit does not depend on initial conditions. Let
         I = equilibrium inventory, a random variable having the limiting distribution of I
      It is relatively easy to determine this distribution. The ergodic property further implies
      that the limiting distribution is precisely & above; that is, I has the same distribution as
      [. So, 7 = E[I].

                     Use this to detennine the distributions of I and
                                                  A   =    equilibrium stockout indicator
                                                  B   ~    equilibrium backorders
                     Then, compute 7 = E[I], A ~ E[A], and B ~ E[B].

                     6.2.2 Base-Stock Policies-A Unit Batch Size
                     6.2.2.1 Discussion
                     Suppose we follow an (r, q) policy with batch size q = I. called a base-stock policy. Such
                     a policy makes sense when economies of scale in the supply system are negligible rela­
                     tive to other factors. For example, when each individual unit is very valuable. holding
                     and backorder costs clearly dominate any fixed order costs. Likewise, for a slow­
                     moving product (one with a low demand rate), the economics of the situation clearly rule
                     out large batch sizes. Also, sometimes there is a naltual quantity unit for both demand
y, under the as­     and supply (e.g., a truckload), and in tenns of that unit it makes sense to set q = I.
nses: First, I is         Since q is fixed to 1, there is only one remaining policy variable, r. It is convenient
here, but it im­     to use the equivalent variable

                     The policy aims to keep the inventory position at the constant value s: If the system starts
                     with IP(O-) :5 s. we immediately order the difference, so that IP(O) ~ s. If IP(O-) > s, we
                     order nothing unlll demand reduces IP(I) to s. Once IP(t) hits s, it remains there from then
                     on. (This explains the names base-slack level and base-stock policy.) The policy is some­

Urther implies       Suppose for now that s 2" 0, and IN(O) ~ 1(0) ~ IP(O-) = s. Thus, orders coincide with

futribution as       demands. Also, each order remains outstanding for time 1. So, IOtt) (outstanding orders)

                     does not depend on the choice of s.

Foundations o!Inventory Management


     Figure 6.2.1 helps to visualize how demands and orders interact. In the lower part
of the figure, each demand is indicated by a vertical line ofheight L. There is a diagonal
line attached to each one with slope - I. So, if there is a demand at I, the diagonal line
meets the time axis at t + L, precisely the moment the corresponding order arrives. Now,
pick an arbitrary time t, not necessarily a demand point, and count the number of diag­
anal lines above the time axis at I. The result is just IO(I). The upper part of the figure
graphs lO(I). (This system has A = 1 and L = 3.)
     Choose any I > L. Any order placed before I - L must have arrived before I, and so
cannot be included in IO(I); and of course, IO(I) does not include any orders placed after
I. The orders included in lO(l) are precisely those placed in the interval (I _. L, I]. But each
such order corresponds to a demand, so IO(I) is sinlply the demand during (I - L, I], or
                                        lO(l)   ~   D(I - L. I]

Consequently, IO(I) has the Poisson distribution with mean U.
   The definition of IP(I) is
                                     IP(I)   ~   IN(I)   + lO(l)
butIP(I) is justthe constant s. So,

                                        IN(I)    =s   - lO(l)	                           (6.2.1)

The net inventory IN(I) is just a translation of IO(I) ~ D(I - L, I]. Also, although we as­
sumed IP(O-) = s, (6.2.1) clearly holds regardless of starting conditions for sufficiently
large I (i.e., such that IP(I - L) = s).
     Since IO(I) has the same distribution for all large I, certainly 10 has a limiting
distribution, and therefore so does IN. The limiting random variable IO has the Poisson
distribution with mean AL. and
                                           IN=s-lO	                                      (6.2.2)

This is the main result. It is convenient to express it in slightly different terms: Call
D(I, I + L] the leadtime demand beginning at I, and let
           D   ~	   leadtime demand, a generic random variable with the Poisson
                    distribution with mean AL
i.e., the same distribution as IO and D(I, I + L]. (The symbol D stood for the demand
during a leadtime in Chapter 3 also, but there it was the constant AL.) Then,
                                 IN(I   + L) = s      - D(I,   I   + L]
                                          IN=s-D	                                        (6.2.3)

As shown later (Theorem 6.2.3), this identity also describes the long-run frequency dis­
tribution oflN.
     We can now compute the key system performance measures: Let g denote the prob­
ability mass function (pmf) of D, d' its complementary cumulative distribution (ccdf),
and G L its loss function. (The latter is G1(d) = E[[D - dt], as in Section C.2.2.) From

                           Incidentally, for any model with Poisson demand, including this one, A is also the
                      long-run fraction of demands backordered, so I - A is the fill rate, the fraction of de­

                      processes. known by the acronym PASTA, which stands for "Poisson arrivals sec time
                      averages." The time average in question here is ~4, and PASTA asserts that a typical ar­
                      riving customer finds no inventory, and so is backordered, with frequency;f We use the

                           To judge the effect of L on overall pelformance, it is useful to graph the same data
                      in a different form, as in Figure 6.2.4. Here, we use the rescaled performance measures
                                       BW    =      average customer backorder waiting time
                                        IW   =      average stocking time, the time a unit spends in inventory
                      instead ofB and 7. Section 6.2.4 shows that BW = BIA andlW ~ 7/1... For each s the figure
                      plots the corresponding values of BWandIW. (The actual values ofs are suppressed.) The
            W         resulting curves show how much stocking time is necessary to achieve a specified waiting
    5       g
                      time. (The logarithmic scale for waiting time reveals the relationships better.)
         5                 It is clear from the figure that performance deteriorates as the leadtime grows. To
                      achieve a given desired waiting time, as L increases, we must increase the stocking time
                      (by increasing s), or, to maintain a given stocking time, we must accept a longer waiting
                      time. There is a clear, tangible benefit to reducing the leadtime.

                      6.2.2.4 Selecting a Policy to Meet a Service Constraint
                      Evidently, there is a conflict between the customer-service measures ,4, B, and inventory
o	
                      I Given a service-level target. e.g_, an upper limit 1 - w_ on A, we want to set s large
                      enough to meet this constraint, but othenvise as small as possible. Conversely, given an up­
                      per limit on 7, set s as large as possible to minimize A andB, while maintaining feasibility.

      EXAMPLE 6.2.A, PART 1
      The manager of a large urban classieal record store is trying to determine a sensible stocking pol­
      icy for a CD of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (played by Bernstein and the New York Philhar­
      monic). Demand for this particular item is a Poisson process of rate 3.6 per month, and the lead­
      time is 2 weeks. The manager aims to fill about 80% of demands directly from stock.
           Express the leadtime as 0.5 months. So, the average lcadtime demand is >...L = (3.6)(0.5) =
      1.8. Direct calculation yields the performance of alternative base-stock policies:

      6        0.01        4.20        0.00



      The performance target is A .:s 1 - tll2 = 0.2, so the manager should set s = 4. With this policy,
      the average inventory will be 2.25.
           You might wonder about the various assumptions here. Classical CDs do have roughly Pois­
      son demands. Many customers, though not all, insist on a particular recording (they will not take,
      say, Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic as a substitute), and are willing to wait a while ifthe item
      is not in stock. Popular CDs, in contrast, sometimes have more volatile demands (as discussed in
      Section 6.3 below), and stockouts are more likely to result in lost sales (sce Section 7.2).

          Another way to resolve the conflict is by cost optimization. We postpone that dis­
      cussion until Section 6.5.


      6.2.3 General Batch Sizes
      Next, we evaluate a general (r, q) policy, where q is any positive integer. Figure 6.2.5 il­
      lustrates the bchavior oOP and IN. The heavy curve is !N(t), and the lighter one is IP(t).
      In this example r = 4 and q = 3. The demands are the same as in Figure 6.2.1; theyoc­
      cur at the times where IN(t) jumps down. IP(t) jumps up (from r + I to r + q) when an
      order is placed, while IN(t) jumps up (by q = 3) when an order is received. Notice that
      there are a few intervals where IN(t) = IP(t), so there are no outstanding orders. The rest
      of the time, IN(t) < IP(t), which means there are some outstanding orders.

      6.2.3.1 Analysis

      Policy evaluation now requires a rather different approach, and more effort, than before.

      The anaiysis proceeds in four steps:

      THEOREM 6.2.3. The limiting distribution of the net inventory is described by the
      equation
                                                        IN= IP-D
      where IP is unifonnly distributed on the integers in the interval [r + I, r + q], D has the
      Poisson distribution with mean AL, and the two variables IP and D are independent. This
      also describes the stationary and long-run frequency distributions of IN.
           Step 4: First, B is precisely the mean of the loug-run frequency distribution of B,
      which is in turn a function of IN. It follows thatB = E[B]; similarly, T ~ E[1].
           Theorem 6.2.3 tells us that IN is the difference oftwo independent random variables,
      IP and D. Condition on IF, say IP ~ s. The distribution of [INIIP = s] is given by (6.2.3).
      The (unconditional) distribution of IN is a simple average of these conditional distribu­
      tions over s = r + 1, ... , r + q. This fact allows us to construct formulas for A, B, and
      7using their counterparts (6.2.4) to (6.2.6) for base-stock policies as building blocks. Let
      A(s), B(s), and 7(0') denote the performance measures for a base-stock policy, now writ­
      ten as explicit functions of s. Likewise, let A(I; q), B(I; q), and 7(1; q) denote the per­
      formance measures for an        (,~   q) policy. Then,

                                 A(I; q) ~ Pr {IN"'" O}

                                            ~ 1;;;;;+, m        Pr {IN"'"   0IfF = s}

                                                 \q
      Similarly,

                                                      B(I; q) =   m1~;;;;+, B(s)           (6.2.9)


                                                      T(I; q)   ~ m1~:;+,T(S)             (6.2.10)

      Thus, system perfonnance using a policy with q > 1 can be represented as a simple av­
      erage of the performance of several base-stock policies.
          We can write these quantities explicitly in terms of the first- and second-order loss
      functions ofD, G 1, and G2 The latter is G2 (d) = 1j>d G1(j) = ~(AL)2 - lO<j";,, G'(j).
      From (6.2.8) to (6.2.10) it immediately follows that

                                            A= (~)[G'(r) - G\r + q)]                      (6.2.11)


                                            B~    (~)[G2(r) -       2
                                                                   G (r + q)]             (6.2.12)

                                            T~    ~(q   + 1) + r   -   U    +B            (6.2.13)

      (Notice the close connection between 1 and B. We observed a similar relation in the case
      of detenninistic demand in Chapter 3. The only difference is that here we have a tenn

described by the     iJ(g + I) instead ofiJg. This difference is entirely a result of the demand quantities be­
                     ing discrete, as indicated in Problem 3.8.)
                          Finally, consider the order frequency OF. Demands occur at rate A, and an order is
                     placed every g demands, so

                     above. However, they give better numerical accuracy for large d, given accurate calcula­
                     tions of GO(d) and g(d).)

                     6.2.3.2 Behavior of Performance Measures
           (6.2.8)
                     Formulas (6.2.8) to (6.2.10) imply that A(r, g), B(r, g), and T(r, g), viewed as functions of
                     r, inherit the qualitative properties of A(s), B(s), and 7(s): For fixed g, E is decreasing and
                     convex in r, while 7 is increasing and convex. (For r ;::: -q, both functions are strictly
                     convex.) A is decreasing in r, but not necessarily convex.
          (6.2.9)
                           The effects of q are more subtle. Of course! OF is decreasing and convex in q. Also,
                     we see immediately from (6.2.8) to (6.2.10) that A and E are decreasing in g for fIXed r,
         (6.2.10)    and 1 is increasing. This fact by itself is not really gennane, however. What matters is the
                     effect of q on the available ranges of the performance measures as r varies.
as a simple av­            We can see this effect by changing variables, as in Figure 6.2.6. For fixed AL = 20
                     and several odd values of g, the figure graphs E and 7 against s' ~ r + iJ(g + I), not r
:ond-order loss      itself. This s' is the center point ofthe integers s = r + 1, ... ,r + q over which the av­
                     erages are computed. As q changes, we adjust r to compare Band 7 at the same center
 LO<j$d G\;).
                     point s'. Viewed in this way, both E and 7 increase as g grows. (This property follows di­
                     rectly from the convexity ofB(s) and 7(s). See Problem 6.2.) The tradeoffbetweenE and
                     7becomes worse for larger g. This is the price we pay to reduce OF.
        (6.2.11)
                           For fixed q. by (6.2.8) to (6.2.10), performance deteriorates as L increases, as in the
                     case g ~ 1. Though it is hard to see at this point, the same effect is felt overall, letting
        (6.2.12)     both rand g vary. (Section 6.5 verifies this statement.)

        (6.2.13)
                     6.2.3.3 Selecting a Policy to Meet a Service Constraint

                     Again, there are conflicts between the performance measures. Suppose that q is fixed.

:ion in the case     Given the constraint A .: : :; I - w_, it is clear what to do: Set r large enough to meet the

oe have a term       service requirement, but otherwise as small as possible.

      EXAMPLE 6.2.A. PART 2

      The record store above must order CDs in batches of size q = 2, for some reason. The data remain
      A = 3.6 and L = 0.5, and the seIVice requirement remains .4::s; 1 ­ w_ = 0.2. The performance
      of certain (r. q) policies is as follows:


       r              .4      7
      -1              092    0.09

       0              0.69   0.40

                      0.41   1.00

       4              0.03   3.71




      So, the manager should set r = 2. This policy has 1= 1.81. (It is odd that this I is less than the
      base-stock policy's in Part 1 above. This is due entirely to the fact that integer policy variables can­
      not always hit a performance target exactly. Recall that the earlier policy with s = 4 has II = 0.11,
      much lower than the required 0.2, while the (r, q) policy here just meets the requirement.)

                    6.2.4 Backorders and Waiting Time
                    Recall from Section 3.3.6 of Chapter 3 that, in that context, there is a close relation be­
                    tween the average backorders and the average customer waiting time, namely, B = ABW.
                    We now argue (somewhat heuristically) that the same relation applies here. Then, we
                    prove (rigorously) an even stronger result.
                         Figure 6.2.7 depicts the waiting times experienced by a few customers. Each cus­
                    tomer is represented by a horizontal bar, beginning when the demand occurs and ending
                    when the demand is filled. Customers who do not wait (numbers 3, 4,8, and 9 here) are
                    indicated by short verticallines--bars ofzero length. Observe, B(t) can be read by count­
                    ing the bars above point t on the horizontal axis.
                         Now. let BW n indicate the cumulative total waiting time experienced by the first 11
ris less than the   demands. Pick a value of t with B(t) = O. Then, BW Dul is just the sum of the lengths of

      (This result is analogous to Little's [1961] formula in the context of queues.) A similar
      argument shows that the average stocking time is related to the average inventory by I =
      VW.
          By the way. this argument is valid for any processes where the averages B, A, and
      IW exist. It does not use the assumptions of Poisson demand and constant leadtimes. The
      result holds for quite general demand and supply processes, induding those of Sec­
      tion 6.3 and Chapter 7.
           Now, BW directly measures service to customers. The fact that it is proportional to
      B is the primary reason that B is important. Also, BW inherits the qualitative properties
      ofB discussed above; for example, increasing s (or r) reduces the average customer wait­
      ing time.
      EXAMPLE 6.2.A, PART 3
      Reconsider the record store above (with A = 3.6). Under the base-stock policy with s = 4,11 =
      0.05, so BW = 0.05/3.6 = 0.014 months, or abont 0.4 days. Under the (r. q) policy with q = r =
      2, B ~ 0.11, so BW = 0.11/3.6 ~ 0.029 months, or 0.9 days.
           The following theorem is a sharper result. (It does assume Poisson demand and con­
      stant leadtimes. Actually, the result holds also for some of the more complex supply sys­
      tems ofChapter 7, but not all; see Section 7.3.8.) LetBW denote the random variable de­
      scribing the limiting distribution of waiting times, so BW = E[BW]. Also, let D(BW)
      indicate demand during the random time BJv, where BW is independent ofD.
      THEOREM 6.2.4. Assuming r             2>   ·-1, B   ~   D(BW).
      Thus, not only are the means of B and BWtightly linked, their distributions too are func­
      tionally dependent. Specifically, the theorem implies the following identity, relating the
      z-transform of B and the Laplace transform of B W:

                      The first identity is simply E ~ ABW, as above. The second enables us to compute the
                      variance of BW from that of B.

                      nomial momenl of B. For a base-stock policy, following the derivation of (6.2.5), one can
                      show that

                      PROOF OF LEMMA 6.2.1. It is convenient to work with a simple transformation of

                            The process IPc is a continuous-time Markov chain. Think of its state space as the

                      integers mod (q). A transition occurs at each demand epoch. At each such epoch I. pro­

      Figure 6.2.8 shows the state-transition diagram for the case q = 8.
           Notice, this diagram is entirely symmetric over the states; rotating the figure
      changes nothing except the labels ofthe states. You might suspect, then, that ifIP c has a
      limiting distribution, it is uniform on the integers mod (q). This is true: The embedded
      discrete-time chain is irreducible, so Markov-chain theory (see Appendix C) tells us that
      IFc has a unique stationary distribution, which is also its limiting distribution and its
      long-run frequency distribution. Moreover, letting e denote a column vector of ones, it
      is clear that (llq)e'[I.( -1+ 1+)] = 0, so the uniform distribution is indeed stationary.
           Actually, the full state space of IP c also includes the negative integers, to account
      for the case IP(O) > I' + q, or IPc(O) < O. But those states are transient. Thus, the result
      above is correct. Finally, IP ~ (I' + q) - IPc' so this has the uniform distribution on the
      integers from r + 1 to r + q. as asserted.

      PROOF OF LEMMA 6.2.2. The quantity !O(t) specifies the total amount of supplies
      arriving during the interval (t, t + L], since orders placed before tmust arrive before t +
      L, while those placed after t arrive after t + L. And, by definition, D(t, t + L] is the de­
      mand during this same interval. Therefore.

                                IN(t   + L)   ~   IN(t)   + !O(t)   - D(t, t   + L]

                   PROOF OF THEOREM 6.2.3. Defme the leadlime-demandprocess, DL = {D(I, t + L]:
                   12: OJ, and consider the joint process lIP, DL). We have seen that IP has a limiting distri­
                   bution, and of course DL has one also, since eachD(I, 1+ L] is distributed identically to D.
                   Furthermore, IP(I) and D(I, I + L] are independent for all t Therefore, the joint process has
                   a limiting distribution: Denote the limiting random variable by [IP, D], where IP is uniformly
                   distributed, D has the Poisson distribution with mean AL, and the two variables are inde­
                   pendent.
                         By equation (6.2.7),IN(1 + L) is just a function ofthisjoint process. Since the joint
                   process has a limiting distribution, so does this function of it, hence so does IN. Let IN
                   denote the limiting random variable. Then, an equation like (6.2.7) must describe IN
                   This is precisely the assertion of the theorem.
                         Finally. this limiting distribution of IN also describes its stationary and long-run fre­
                   quency distributions: Lemma 6.2.1 shows that this is true ofIP. Since DL is also ergodic,
                   and for each I IP(I) andD(l, 1+ L] are independent, the joint process (IP, DL) itself is er­
                   godic, hence so is IN. Thus, IN fully characterizes the long-run behavior ofIN, as asserted.
                   PROOF OF THEOREM 6.2.4. Suppose the system starts at time I = 0 with inven­
                   tory r + g, no backorders, and no outstanding orders. Define
                               B~rr =   backorders observed by the nth arriving customer
                               B~lep = backorders remaining after the nth customer's demand is filled

                               BWn = waiting time of customer n
                   (Customer n is never included in B~n'; also, if the demands of customers nand n + 1 are
                   filled simultaneously, we count customer n + 1 among B~ep.) The corresponding limit­
                   ing random variables (as n --> 00) are denoted B m , Bd'P, and BW.
OIg the figure           First, because demands are filled in order and the leadtimes are constant, B~ePis pre­
IJat iflP, has a   cisely the number of demands during the time BW" following customer n's demand.
fbe embedded       Also, BW" depends on D up to the moment n's demand occurs, but not afterwards. (This
C) tells us that   is because, for n 2: r + g, the order for the unit used to fill n's demand is triggered by
bution and its     the demand of some customer m ::; n. Here, we have used the assumption r 2" -1.) Con­
:tor of ones, it   sequently, B~'P has the same distribution as D(BW,,), where we treat BW" and D as iude­
d stationary.      pendent. Thus, BMP = D(BW).
TS, to account           Second, apply what is called a level-crossing argument: Fix some positive integer i,
hus, the result    and follow the function B(I), focusing attention on when B(I) changes between i and i + I.
ibution on the     A jump from i up to i + I must reflect the demand of some customer; that customer ob­
                   serves i backorders, so it is counted among those having B~rr = i. On the other hand, a
'It ofsupplies     change from i + I down to i means that some customer's demand is finally filled, and that
ive before I +     customer is counted among those with B~ep = i. (Remember, ifseveral demands are filled
- L] is the de-    at once, so B(t) jumps down by more than I, we count this as several simultaneous unit
                   jumps.) But each jump from i to i + I must be followed by a jump from i + I to i before
                   the next such upward jump can OCCUI. SO, in the long run, the proportions of customers in
                   these two groups must be equal. Since this is true for every i, B m = Bdep.
                         Third, because of the PASTA property of Poisson processes, B"T ~ B. Combining
                   all three of these identities, we have B ~ Bm ~ Bd'P = D(BW).

6.3 World-Driven Demand
          6.3.1 Discussion
          A Poisson process often closely approximates real demands. The approximation is rarely
          perfect, however, and some demand processes behave in a decidedly non-Poisson man­
          ner. This section explores a more general and complex demand model.
               Suppose that demands still occur one at a time, but as time passes, events occur that
          affect future demands. (This is not true of a Poisson process.) Thmk of these events as
          changes in some system, which we call the world. We model the world by a stochastic
          process W = {W(t) : t 2" O}. This system is exogenous; nothing we do affects the evo­
          lution of W. The behavior of W, however, affects the demand process D. The overall
          model of demand is the joint process (W, D). Here are some examples:
              Weather. The demand for many products depends on current weather conditions.
              Think of umbrellas. sun-tan lotion, and heating oil. Here, W includes the relevant
              variables, such as temperature and rainfall.
              Economy. Alternatively, W might represent the general economic conditions in a
              country, region, or industry. Demands for such products as automobiles and office
              supplies tend to ary with the level of economic activity.
              Competition. Suppose 'V represents the state of competition in the market for a
              product. It may include the current level of technology, the strengths of competing
              products, consumers' tastes, and so forth. Such factors do change over time, and
              our beliefs about subsequent demands change with them. A company introducing
              a new product, for example, faces just such uncertainties. Likewise, think of a
              mature product industry with a high rate of innovation. like computers and
              pharmaceuticals, or clothing, perfume, and other fashion goods: there, every
              product is in danger of partial or total obsolescence.
              Customer status. Suppose demands represent orders from a few large customers.
              In this case W models the relevant conditions at each customer's site, including
              perhaps their own inventories.
               Forecasting. Many demand-forecasting techniques are based, explicitly or
               implicitly, on a model of some world system. The forecasting methodology
               involves tracking certain variables, corresponding to W, which in turn are the
               main inputs to a forecast of future demand. In some cases the variables in W have
               real physical meaning (the weather, the economy, etc.), but in others they are just
               statistical constructs. (Section Y. 7.1 discusses specific examples.)

of D(t), that is,         At this point you may be worried: Yes, all sorts of factors may affect demand, but
                     how can we model them all? Do we really need a full-scale model of the weather and/or
                     the economy? (You may be aware that meteorologists and economists build huge, com­
                     plex models, and even those don't always work very well.) It would take a marketing ge­
                     nius to measure competitive conditions, let alone to understand their dynamics!
                          Relax. Our purpose here is to understand what happens given a world-demand model
                     (W, D). As we shall see, the central results of Section 6.2, even the performance formulas,
                     continue to hold. The only difference is in the leadtirne-demand random vatiahle D. We do
                     have to compute or estimate its distribution, but no more than that. Moreover, as shown in
                     Section 6.4, for many practical purposes, it is sufficient to estimate just two parameters,
                     the average demand rate Aand another one that measures demand variation.
                          So, to use the results entails some extra work, but we control how much. For a very
imation is rarely
   important product, it may be worthwhile to construct a detailed, explicit model of
In-Poisson man­      (W, D), hut in other cases we can get by with much less, a simpler, approximate model
                     of (w, D) or just a couple of statistical estimates. Indeed, one can view the model as a

                     tion, hut that is not critical here.) Also, W is well behaved, like the processes discussed
ther conditions.

                     in Section 6.2.1 above; it is ergodic and has a limiting distribution. So, it is meaningful
des the relevant

                     to talk about equilibrium conditions. (So, ifW includes a weather model, it is valid only
                     for short time intervals, except perhaps in the tropics. Time-varying world models are
 conditions in a

                     discussed in Section 9.7.) Finally, W captures all events that affect D. That is, the joint

    process (W, D) is itself a Markov process; this process too is well hehaved.
                          The results allow W to start in any initial state at time O. An important special case

      larger or smaller ratio. This is the new demand parameter; it is a fundamental character­
      istic of the process. So, for large L, V[D] = ",2 AL.
            By the way, you might expect that the information embodied in the state W(t) can
      be profitably used to help make ordering decisions. Indeed it can. Here, however, we
      evaluate an (I; q) policy with fixed rand q, which by definition does not adapt orders to
      W(t). (I; q) policies are widely used in practice, because they are so simple to implement.
      It is often difficult or impossible to observe W(t) in real time; even when W(t) is ob­
      servable, it is often hard to process and employ the infonnation. Thus, it is worthwhile
      to see what happens under an (I; q) policy, even in settings like this one, where in prin­
      ciple some more complex policy works better. In the process, we shall see just how ro­
      bust the techniques above are to the Poisson-demand assumption. (Section 6.7.2 and
      Section 9.7 consider more refined policies which do use the information in W(t).)


      6.3.2 The MCDC Process
      Let us explore one particular class of world-driven demand processes. These are built
      from continuous-time Markov chains. (Section C.5 reviews this concept. If you are com­
      fortable with it, the discussion here will help make the notion of world-driven demand
      more concrete. Ifnot, you may prefer to skim this subsection.) While they are special in
      some ways, they still offer a great range of modeling tJexibility, and they can be used to
      approximate still more general processes.
           Assume that W is a finite-state, irreducible, continuous-time Markov chain. Let Q de­
      note the generator of W and ~ its statioruny probability vector. Also. conditional on W(t),
      demand in the near futnre acts like a Poisson process. Specifically. decompose Q as follows:
                                               Q   = QO _   AD   +A
      where QO itself has the form of a generator (its off-diagonal elements are nonnegative and
      (fe = 0, where e is a column-vector of ones); A ~ (A"..,,) is nonnegative; and
      AD ~ diag (Ae), a nonnegative diagonal matrix. These matrices represent different kinds of
      events: When a transition represented in QO occurs, W changes state, but there is no demand.
      The matrix A, on the other hand, gives the rates of events that do generate
      demands; W may also change. Specifically, ifW is now in state W, a demand occurs and
      W jumps from w to w' at rate A~'. The diagonal entries in A describe demands that leave
      W unchanged. Finally, AD simply summarizes the overall state-specific demand rates in A-
           Thus, to specify the model fully, we need only specify the two matrices QO and A,
      or equivalently Q and A. The joint process (W, D) is itself a continuous-time Markov
      chain. We call D a Markov-chain-driven counting process, or MCDC process.
           Such models, like Markov chains generally, can differ greatly in complexity, de­
      pending on the number of states W has, which determines the sizes of the matrices.
      There is no limit to the complexity, in principle, but of course the modeling and compu­
      tational difficulties increase as the number of states grows.
           A couple of special cases are worth mentioning: D is a Markov-modulated Poisson
      process, or MMP process, when A = AD, so the off-diagonal elements of A are all zero
      and Q = QO In this case, transitions of Wand demands are distinct events. During any
      interval between changes in W, D behaves like a Poisson process, but the demand rate

                              For simplicity, we state and prove the results assuming that demand is an MCDC process.
                              They are valid more generally, however. We need a mild technical assumption:

                              This assumption holds for most reasonable models. For example, it is true when D is an MMP
                              or a renewal process. (See Problem 6.4. Section 6.3.5 discusses the assumption further.)

                              LEMMA 6.3.1. Under the assumption above, the joint process (IP, W) has a limiting
                              distribution, IP is uniformly distributed on the integers in the interval [r + I, r + q], and
                              IP and Ware independent.
                              In particular, the limiting behavior of the joint process is insensitive to the specification

           The next result is analogous to Theorem 6.2.3:
      THEOREM 6.3.2. Under the assumption above, the limiting distribution ofthe net in­
      ventory is described by the equation

                                               IN~IP-D

      where IP is uniformly distributed on the integers in the interval [r + I, r + '1]. D is the
      leadtime demand starting in equilibrium, and the two variables IP and D are indepen­
      dent. This also describes the long-run frequency distribution ofIN.
           We are thus led to a remarkable conclusion: Formulas (6.2.11) to (6.2.13) can still
      be used to calculate A, B, and I We need only redefine GO, G 1, and G' to describe the
      new D. The performance measures depend only on this single distribution, not on finer
      details of the demand process. Also, of = )J'1, as before. In the special case '1 ~ 1, the
      simplerformulas (6.2.4) to (6.2.6) apply. Equations (6.2.8) to (6.2.10) continue to relate
      the results for general '1 to their counterparts for '1 = 1.
           As for customer waiting, recall that the relation B ~ VlW continues to hold here.
      The sharper results of Section 6.2.4 (Theorem 6.2.4 and Corollary 6.2.5), however, do
      not. Still, analogous results can be used as approximations. For example, an approximate
      relation between V[B] and V[BW], analogous to (6.2.17), is given by
                                     V[B] = >Ii'J\E[BW]     + J\'V[BW]                           (6.3.1)
           Regarding computation, GO can be computed directly from g, and recursions
      (6.2.16) and (6.2.17) can be used to compute G 1 and G' from d. As discussed above,
      however, it is rather difficult to calculate g. Thus, evaluating A, B. and I is no simple mat­
      ter. [Formulas (6.2.14) and (6.2.15) depend on the specific form of the Poisson distribu­
      tion; they do not apply here.] Section 6.4 develops a workable approximation. Also,
      oddly enough, exact performance evaluation becomes easier in certain stochastic-lead­
      time models; see Section 7.5.2.
            One qualification is necessary: The quantity A is still the probability of being out of
      stock, but not the !taction of demands backordered. (The PASTA property does not hold for
      non-Poisson demand.) That fraction can be computed in another way, but we shall not do so.


      6.3.4 Behavior ofPerformance Measures
      Because the performance formulas retain the same form as in the Poisson-demand case,
      their qualitative properties remain the same: For base-stock policies, ]j is decreasing and
      convex in s, while Tis increasing and convex (strictly, for s 2:: 0). A is decreasing, but not
      convex. For general q, IJ is decreasing and convex in ,; while T is increasing and convex
      (strictly, for r '2: -'1). Also,B(s') andI(s') are increasing in '1, in the manner ofFigure 6.2.6.
            It is interesting to explore how performance depends on the demand model itself.
      We focus here on base-stock policies. Figure 6.3.3 graphs I andB for the two examples
      above, as well as a Poisson process with the same demand rate, J\ = 10, all with L ~ 2.
      Recall, the MMP process has the largest V[ D] among the three, and the renewal process
      the smallest. We see here that I and B seem to increase along with V[D]. That is, the
      larger the demand variation, the l'mrse the system performs.

                      Before proving the results, let us explore the assumption of Section 6.3.3 at greater
                      length: As noted above, most reasonable demand models satisfy it. However, here is a

l-demand case,
                                                                                       °

       of the market, with the demand rate decreasing in D(t). (See Mahajan and Wind [1986]
       for examples.) Clearly, the joint process is reducible.
            On the other hand, suppose Wet) increases whenever a demand occurs, but Wet) can
       also decrease between demands. Such a construct could model a market with limited ca­
      pacity to absorb short-term demand surges, provided the market adjusts so that recent
      demands are "forgotten" in the long run. It is not hard to check that, indeed, the as­
      sumption is now satisfied.
      PROOF OF LEMMA 6.3.1. Because the joint process (IP, W) has a finite number ofstates,
      and in view of the assumption, we need only show that the distribution described in the
      lemma is stationary. We shall give two separate arguments, each instructive in its own way.
          First, here is a direct algebraic argument. The generator of the joint process (IP c' W)
      can be written
                                      10 QO -10 AD + 1+ 0 A
      (1+ is the shift mod (q) matrix in the proof of Lemma 6.2.1 above; Section C.S.3 inAp­
      pendix C explains the Kronecker product notation 0.) The first term corresponds to
      transitions ofW without demands, while the second and third together describe demand
      events, hence changes in IP C' whether or not W changes at the same time. We wish to
      show that the probability row-vector (l/q)(e' 0 !;) is stationary for (IP" W); that is,
      when we multiply this vector by the matrix above, the result is zero. But, since e' J = e'l +
       ~ e' and !;Q = 0, we have

      (e' 0!;)(10 Qo -10AD + 1+ 0A) ~ e' 0 [W! - AD + A)] = e'0(W) ~ 000

                                  This completes the first argument. For the second, suppose the system begins at time
                              with [IPiO), W(O)] having the distribution described in the assertion. Now, for any I;=: 0,
                                                                                                                            °
                                                    [!Pil)1 W(I)] = {!PiO)     +   [D(t) I W(I)]} mod (q)
                              The expression on the right-hand side consists of a random variable IPiO) distributed
                              uniformly on the integers mod (q), plus another random variable [D(t)IW(t)] indepen­
                              dent of IPiO), all mod (q). Any such combination, it turns out, is also uniformly dis­
                              tributed. (This can be checked directly, as Problem 6.5 asks you to do; or see Feller
                              [1971], page 64.) Thus, [IPil)IW(I)] has the uniform distribution on the integers mod
                              (q); in particular, IPJI) and W(I) are independent. Finally, W(t) itsdfhas the same dis­
                              tribution as W(O), namely, the stationary distribution ofW.
                                   The assumption truly is necessmy for the result. Consider the example above, where
                              W has only two states and q ~ 2. It is still tme that (l/q)(e' ® ~) is a stationary vector
                              for the joint process, but there are others as well; the stationaty vector is not unique. Also.
                              if the transition rates between the two states of W are different, then the limiting distri­
                              bution of IP" depends on the initial state, and typically this distribution is not uniform.
                              PROOF OF THEOREM 6.3.2. Consider the joint process (IP, DL), as in the proof
                              of Theorem 6.2.3 above, but expand it to (IP, W, DL). By assumption, D(I, I + L] de­
                              pends on the past (through time t) ofIP, W, and D only through W(I). On the other hand,
                              (IP, W) has a limiting distribution, in which IP and Ware independent. Thus, the entire
    LOOO
                              process (IP, W. DL) has a limiting distribution, and lP is independent of [W, D]. Fur­
                              thermore,IN(t + L) continues to be described by equation (6.2.7); in particular, IN is a
                              function of (IP, W, DL). Taking the limit as 1--> 00, the result follows immediately.

                              We first focus on base-stock policies. Consider the Poisson-demand model, where D has

            For most plausible world-driven rlemand processes too, D is approximately normal
      for large L. (This is true of every MCDC process.) Again, v ~ E[D] = AL. It is possible
      tu compute the exact variance V[D], but in the interest of simplicity, let us use the linear
      approximation V[D] :=o-J \{lA.L, where ~/ is the asymptotic variance-to-mean ratio. That
      is, set

      is the standard normal loss function; it is the standard-normal analogue of G . The fol­
      lowing identities are useful:

           Now, following the analysis of Section 6.2.2, using the normal approximation to D
      in (6.2.3), we obtain

      The formulas above can then be written even more simply:
                                                     A = 1>°(2)                                           (6.4.4)

           How accurate is this approximation? First, consider the Poisson-demand case.
      Figure 6.4.1 graphs exact and approximate performance measures for A = 10 and two
      values ofL, 0.5 and 1. In these cases, evidently, the approximation is extremely accurate.
      For larger AL, the approximation is even closer. Only for very small 'AL does the ap­
      proximation give poor results_
           The corresponding resnlts for the MMP process of Section 6.3.2 (with ~,2 ~ 1.45)
      are shown in Figure 6.4.2. The approximation is not quite as precise as before, but still

                      it is fairly good. (Part of the discrepancy, of course, is caused by the approximate value
                             2
                      of a  .) Again, for larger L, the approximation becomes still more accurate.
                           The normal approximation makes some people uncomfortable, because it allows D
                      to assume negative values. (This is not a weakness at all, of course, when customers can
                      return items. For instance, retailers can usuaIly return unsold CDs to manufacturers.
                      While such situations are not uncommon, they are not the general rule.) Remember, we
                      use the approximation, not to describe the dynamics of the system in detail, but rather to
                      predict performance, and it does that very well in many cases. Still, the approximation
                      tends to work best when it predicts a small Pr {D < O} = <p o[-v/a),.r1amely, when the
                      coefficient of variation a/v is small. For Poisson demand, IT/v = lIVAL, and this is one
                      reason the approximation works poorly for small AL.
         (6.4.4)
                          One note of caution: The nOffilal approximation does capture the broad features of
         (6.4.5)      performance, but it is not precise when pushed to extremes. Suppose we have a stringent
                      performance requirement, specifying a tiny value of .4, say 0.001. We know that s must
         (6.4.6)
                      be large. but how large? The normal approximation does not always give the right an­
emand case.           swer. In technical terms, it does not provide an asymptotically precise estimate ofthe tail
, 10 and two          probabilities; the ratio <po(z)/Co(s) does not go to I as s --> 00. (This assumes, of course,
ely accurate.         that the model and the data are exactly correct. Errors from those sources usually dom­
does the ap-          inate those of the approximation.)
                           In general, the appropriateness ofthe normal approximation depends partly on L be­

      enough, then prudence dictates using the exact fonnulas. On the other hand, if we are
      conducting a large-scale analysis to support systems design, the approximation is usu­
      ally quite adequate for any L. III that I..:ase, therefore.. there is no need to model the world­
      demand system (W, D) explicitly, nor even to estimate the full distribution of D. It is
      enough to estimate f... and ~2 directly.
           Suppose that we are comfortable with the approximation. Formulas (6.4.4) to (6.4.6)
      are quite easy to usc. For instance, to meet a service·level requirement A = ] - w _, find
      the value of z such that <l>°(z) = I - OL from a table of the standard nonnal distribution
      (or a computerized equivalent), and set s =. v + Z(J. (As mentioned in Section c'Z.5.4,
      In [4>°(z)] = - 'IZ2 for large z. So, for I - w_ near 0, z = [-2 In (l - W_)]I/l and s =
      v + [- 2 In (I - w _)] 1/2 cr. This is a rough, qualitative indication of how s grows as the
      service requirement becomes more stringent. However, as discussed above: the nonnaI
      approximation loses accuracy in this range, so this estimate should be used with care.)
           This z is sometimes called the safetyfactor. It depends only on w_. It is positive precisely
      when (u_ >~. as is usually the case. If v changes but 0" doesu't,just shift s by the same amount
      to maintain z. If IT changes, the safety factor indicates the direction and magnitude of the ap­
      propriate change in s. Following these rules, the average inventory is then proportional to 0".
      Thus, the key parameter affecting perfonnance is cr, the standard deviation of Jeadtime de­
      mand. (The cost-optimization approach of Section 6.5 leads to similar conclusions.)
           By the way, some common practices deviate sharply from this approach. Certain
      firms follow guidelines of the form, "keep 2 weeks of inventory" or "keep 2 weeks of

                    suming time is measured in weeks). So, IT plays no role at alL There is no justification
 5                  for rules of this kind. They are recipes for trouble.

 ~                  Likewise, as the demand rate grows (with \~' fixed), so do 1 and S. However, D' grows
                    more slowly than 'AL itself; that is, the performance measures display a sort of statistical
                    economy ofscale. If A doubles, for example, and we adjust s to maintain the same value
 3                  of z, then 1 and S both increase by only     Vi, not 2.
     f                    This pattern of sensitivity is similar to the EOQ model's, though the reason here is
                    entirely different. When we double A, the new D is the smn of two independent copies of
     g"             the original. The standard deviation only increases by        Vi, essentially because a small

                    grows.) The same thing happens if we doubleL, because D has independent increments-­
                    exactly in the case of Poisson demand, approximately for MCDC demand-so V[D] is
                    linear (exactly or approximately) in L.

      i.e., [l1(Z) = J; [l°(t) dt. Suppose we approxilnate D by v + o-z. (Unlike the normal ap­
      proximation, this construction does not match the moments of D. In fact, while Z has
      zero mean, its variance is infinite.) The approximate performance measures are similar
      in fonn to the nonnal approximation's:
                                                A = [l°(z)
                                                B=   [l1(z)<r             7=     [l1( -z)<r

      where z = (s - v)/<r is again the standardized value of s.
          We call this the maximal approximation. It turns out that, for any D with E[D] = v
      and V[D] ~ <r2, this estimate ofB is always more than the true average backorders. Like­
      wise, 7 above is an upper bound on the true inventory. (See Problem 6.10.) Thus, given
      only v and (J2, this approach provides conservative estimates of performance.
          Just as in the normal approximation, for fixed z. B and 7 are both proportional to cr.
      Thus, (J is again the primary determinant of performance. as measured by these worst­
      case estimates.

      6.4.3 General (r, q) Policies
      For an (r, q) policy, we also replace the actual distribution of IP by the continuous uni­
      form distribution on the real numbers in the interval [r, r + q]. (Actually, it is more ac­
      curate to use the interval [r + Y., r + q + v,]. We use [r, r + q] here to simplify the no­
      tation. For the more accurate method, just replace r by r + Y. in all the formulas below.)
           Suppose we use the normal approximation of D. The standardized analogue of G'
      is the function
                                                 <1>'(=)   =   r: (x -         z)<I>°(X) dx

      One can show that
                              <l>2(Z) =     J; <1>' (x) dx =            y'[(Z2   +   1)<I>°(z) - z<l>(z)]           (6.4.8)

           Now set
                                                   r-v                            r+q-v

      To derive the performance measures, there are two alternative approaches, which lead to
      the same results: Follow the analysis leading to the exact formulas (6.2.11) to (6.2.13),

      as the perfonnance measures, not approximations. They are popular because they are                        ruI

      and they are not reliably accurate. It is necessary to know about them, because they are                  tbI
      so widely known and used, but 1 do not recommend them.
           First, consider the following approximations of A and B:                                             is
                                                                                                                 pi

                                                                                                                 III
      Compare these formulas to (6.2.11) and (6.2.12). Clearly, A+ 1 is similar to A in (6.2.11),
      but it omits the term -(l/q)G 1(r + q). Likewise, B+ 1 omits tbe second term ofB in                        IIIlj
      (6.2.12). Because the omitted terms are negative, /1+ 1 2': A andB+ 1 2: B. These approx­

      imations overestimate the exact quantities. The errors can be severe. For example, for the
      exponential approximation, it is easy to sbow tbatA +lIA = l3 + /B = 1/(1 - e -qlv). This
      can be quite large when qlv is small. That is, these approximations are unreliable, unless
      we can be certain that qlv is large.
           Second, consider the following approximations:
                                     A+ 2 = GO(r)      B+ 2 ~ G\r)                                     6.5 OPtimi1
      Recall, A is the averagc ofthe q numbers GO(s), r -; s < r + q. and A+ 2 replaces tbe
      average by the first one. Since CO is nonincreasing, A+ 2 2:': A. Likewise, B+ 2 2:': E. So,
      like those above, these approximations overestimate the true quantities. Whereas A + 1
      and E+ I are most accurate when q is large,A+ 2 and E +2 work best for small q. These                           1
      approximations too can give wildly inaccurate results. For the exponential approxima­                           I
      tion, A+ 2 IA = B+ 2 /B = (qlv)/(l - e- qIV ), which can be enormous, unless we know in
      advance that qlv is small.
              By the way, A+ 2 is sometimes proposed as an alternative measure of customer ser­
      vice. It is the probability of mnning out ofstock during an order leadtime. But, this does
      not measure customer service in any meaningful way. Customers might well care about
      A andB. but not what happens during one of our leadtimes.
              So, neither of these approximations is particularly reliable. As for simplicity, well,
      to evaluate a policy, either approximation requires about half the computational effort of
      the exact formulas. This is not a compelling improvement.
              The approximations do have a slight advantage when it comes to selecting a policy
      to meet a specified requirement: For example. suppose q is already deteTIllined some­
      how, so the remaining problem is to choose r, and there is a given target value I - ClL
      for A. Suppose we use the normal approximation for D. Using the exact formula (6.4.9)
      for A, we must solve A = I -- ClL for r, a nonlinear equation in one unknown. Using ap­
      proximation A+ 2 , the equation becomes ct>°(zr) = I - w_.
              Now, it is not terribly difficult to solve the exact equation by numerical methods
      with a computer. The approximate equation, however, can be solved manually: Just read
      z,. ~ (<1>0) -1(1 - 0>_) from a table ofthe standard normal distribution, and set r = v +
      Z,.(J'. Likewise, the analogous equation based on A+ 1 requires a single table lookup (in
      this case a table of<1>I).
              Indeed, these approximations first became popular in the days before computers
      were widely available. Armed only with a handbook of statistical tables and a slide
                                                                                                                                       ...

because they are                 rule, an analyst could solve the approximate equation readily, whereas the exact equa­
ot much simpler,                 tion required tedious iterations. Today, however, this is no longer a good reason to use
because they are                 the approximations.
                                      Also, since A + 1 and A +2 overestimate A, the r obtained from either approximation
                                 is larger than the solution to the exact equation, sometimes much larger. Thus, the ap­
                                 proxlmations lead to higher-than-necessary inventory. This is a good reason to avoid
                                 them.

      Assume that there are no scale economies in supply; that is, k = O. As discussed in Sec­              Q
      tion 6.2, this is the case where a base-stock policy makes sense. Again, s = r + 1 is the

      base-stock level. The average-cost function becomes

                                            C(s)   = h7(s) + bB(s)                          (6.5.2)

           Figure 6.5.1 illustrates this function. For small s, 7(s) is negligible andB(s) is nearly        (II
      linear with slope -I; thus, C(s) is nearly linear with slope - b in this range. For large s,

      B(s) goes to zero. while 7(s) becomes linear with slope + I, so C(s) becomes linear with

      slope h. Finally, as noted in Section 6.2.2, 7(s) andB(s) are both convex functions, so C(s)

      is too.

           We can express C(s) in another useful fonn: Define the function

                     where w is the cost ratio b/(b + h), as in Chapter 3. For simplicity, assume that D has a
                     positive pdf((x), at least for x '" o. So, FO(x) is strictly decreasing, and (6.5.3) has a
                     unique solution, say s*. This is the optimal base-stock level. If the approximate D is pos­
ben,                 itive (Fo(x) = I for x sO), then s* is positive.
                          To detennine s*, then, means to solve the single nonlinear equation (6.5.3), a nu­
                     merical problem for which a variety of standard methods are available. In certain special
                     cases, the solution can be computed in closed fonn, as shown below.
                          Recalling that A(s) ~ FO(s), equation (6.5.3) prescribes the following simple rule

                     6.5.2.2 NormalApproximation
                     Specifically, consider the normal approximation of D. That is, use (6.4.5) and (6.4.6) for
                     7(5) and Ii(s) in the cost function (6.5.2). In terms of z = (s - v)/IT and the standard nor­
                     mal ccdf <po, equation (6.5.3) now reads
                                                              <p°(z) ~ I - w

                     That is, the optimal base·stock level can be written
                                                              s*   =   v   + z*rr
                     where z* = (<po) -'(I - w). Computing the optimal policy, like meeting a specified tar­
                     get level, essentially reduces to a search through a standard-nonnal table or a computer­
                     ized equivalent.
                          Thus, the standardized optimal base-stock level z* depends only on the relative
                     costs, not on v and rr, hence not on the supply and demand processes. The leadtime­
                     demand parameters tell us how to determine s* from z*, through the linear relationship
                     above. Again, z* is called the safety factor. It is positive and so s* > v, when w > 75 or
                     b > h. Generally, z* is increasing in w, becoming arbitrarily large as w approaches 1.
                     Indeed, as in Section 6.4.1, for I - w near 0, z< = [-2 In (I - W)]1/2
                          For the optimal s = s*, the performance measures become
                                               Ii(s<) = <P'(z<)IT          7(s<) ~ <P'(-- z<)IT

          so the optimal cost is simply
                      C* = h<I>\ -z*)o-     + b<I>\z*)o- ~   (b   + h)[(1   - w)z*   + <I>\z*)]o­
                          = (b   + h)<f>(z*)o­
                          =   bY(z*)o­
          where Yeo) - ¢(z)/<I>(z). (The second equality uses dIe definitions of z* and <1>1, while
          the last uses the definition of w.) Also, one can show that, for fixed h and I - w near 0,
          c* = h[ -2 In (l - w)] 1I2 0-.
               Notice, C* is the product of three terms: The first (b) is essentially a scale factor,
          measuring the overall magnitude of the cost coefficients. (If the monetary unit changed,
          say from £ to 't, only this telIll would change.) The second term (Y(z')) depends on the
          relative costs of inventory and backorders through the ratio w. These two terms summa­
          rize the economics of the problem. Only the last term (IT} depends on the physical dy­
          namics of demand and supply. Thus, for fixed cost factors, the performance measures
          and the optimal cost are all proportional to (T.
               This finding strengthens the earlier observation that tJ is a primary detenninant of
          performance. For example. IT is proportional to         Vi,
                                                                 so C* is also. To the extent we im­
          prove the supply and demand processes so as to reduce tY, we can thereby reduce the
          overall cost of operating the system.
               Indeed, suppose we somehow reduce a to a _, while the cost factors remain un­
          changed. Then, the new optimal cost as a fraction ofthe old one is simply tY _Ia. The cost
          saving in percentage terms is entirely independent ofthe cost parameters. Inventory and
          backorders both decrease hy this same ratio.

          6.5.2,3 Maximal Approximation
          The maximal approximation yields similar results. Again, s* = v            + .:*a, where.:* solves
                                                  1[ I-z ]
                                         n° (")- - -2 -(1 + Z2)112 ­-   I - w


          This equation can be solved explicitly:
                                              w - 112
                                    z*        ----
                                            [w(l - W)]112

                                    c*    ~ (b I h)[w(1 - w)]112 11 - (bh)ll7 cr

          (Problem 6.15 asks you to verify these results.)
               Because the maximal approximation provides an upper bound onB and 1, the cor­
          responding value of C(s) is an upper bound on the true cost for any s. Consequently, c*
          here is an upper bound on the optimal cost. (Well, not quite: This allows fractional s*.
          To get a true upper hound, restrict s* to an integer; this yields a slightly higher value. For
          most practical purposes, however, we can treat C* as an upper bound.)
               So, the maximal optimal cost loo is proportional to tY. This fact further emphasizes
          the centrality of cr.

      (2k)Jhw)l/2 and C k = hwqk = (2k'Ahw)l/2. For the base-stock model, lets* denote the op­
      timal base-stock level and Crr ~ CCs*) the optimal cost. Also, C a + = (bh)1I2" denotes
      the base-stock model's optimal cost under the maximal approximation. Finally, let qrr ~

           Let us examine these results before proving them. (6.5.5) says that the interval
      [r*, r* + q*], i.e., the optimal range of IP, covers s*. (6.5.6) and (6.5.7) are bounds on
      q* and c* that require knowledge of ,,2 ~ V[D], but no more information about D.
      (6.5.8) and (6.5.9) provide refined bounds which do depend on D through Co'
          The results indicate that the model inherits the sensitivity analyses of both the
      EOQ and the base-stock models. at least approximately. For example, q* and c* are
      bounded both above and below by functions proportional to yk. So, q* and c* are ro­
      bust with respect to changes in k, just as in the EOQ model. Likewise, q* and c* are
      bounded by functions proportional to <T. So, <T degrades performance as before; lead­
      time-demand uncertainty can only increase cost, and only by a limited amount. In sum,
      everything we have learned about the determinants ofperformance and the benefits of
      system improvements continues to apply here. (See Problem 6.18 for more on sensi­
      tivity analysis.)
            Also, the bounds on q* suggest plausible heuristics for setting q; the simplest is qk
      itself. We can use any such heuristic directly, or as the initial value in an optimization pro­
      cedure. As for r, (6.5.5) indicates some value of the forms* - I3q, where 0 -so 13 -so I. (The
      proofbelow suggests setting 13 between (I - w) and Y.:.) Likewise, the bounds suggest rea­
      sonable approximations of C* for rough-cut economic studies.
            Here is a numerical example. Fix A = 10 and L = 1, and use the normal approxi­
      mation. The cost parameters are k = 4, h = 1, and b = 24. We examine several values
      of" ranging from 0 to 8. (If demand were Poisson, <T =             VU= 3.16, about the middle
      of this range.) Figure 6.5.2 shows the true optin,"1 cost C* (the heavy curve) and the
      bounds (6.5.9) (the lighter curves). Notice, C* is increasing in <T, becoming nearly lin­
      ear lor large <T, as are both bounds. Figure 6.5.3 shows q* along with the bounds (6.5.8).
      Evidently, q* grows very slowly as cr increases, so qk is a fairly close approximation.
      (The upper bound badly overestimates q* for large <T. Its main value is in qualitative sen­
      sitivity analysis, as above.)

      Thus, C_ and C+ are translated versions of the convex, piecewise-linear function         t.   See
      Figure 6.5.4. We claim that
                                                  C_(s):5 C(s):5 C+(s)                         (6.512)

      as in the figure. First, C(s) = E[C(s - D)], so Jensen's inequality (see Section C.2.2)
      yields the first inequality in (6.5.12). The second inequality is immediately apparent,
      since C+(s*) = Crr = C(s*), and C+(s) is steeper than C(s), both above and below s*.
            Now, replace C(s) by C_(s) in the cost function (6.5.11), and call the result C_(/; q).
      It is easy to show (Problem 3.10) that this is precisely the cost function ofthe determin­
      istic model, and (6.5.12) implies C(r, q) 2" C_(r, q) for all (r, q). Thus, C* 2" C" which
      is the lower bound in (6.5.7).
            The lower bound in (6.5.9) comes from applying a similar argument to the function
      C_ +(s) = max {CmC_(s)}. (This is another piecewise-linear function, in this case with
      three pieces. It replaces the lowest parts of C _ (s) with a horizontal segment at level Crr-)
      Clearly, C_+(s) :5 C(s). So, substituting C_+(s) for C(s) in (6.5.11) yields a lower bound
      on C*, and direct calculation shows that this bound is (C; + C~)I12.
            Likewise, replace C(s) by C+(s) in (6.5.11), and call the result C+(r, q). Clearly,
      C+(r, q) ~ Crr + C_(r', q), where y' = r - s* + v. Thus, the minimal value of C+(r, q)
      is Crr + Ck . (The translation of y' leaves the minimum unchanged.) But (6.5.12) implies
      C(r, q) :5 C +(r, q) for all (r, q), so C* :5 Crr + C" which is the upper bound in (6.5.9).
            For the upper bound in (6.5.7), fix D for the moment, and let V ~ y - D. Direct cal­
      culation yields

           Now let us prove the bounds on q*. The optimality conditions for minimizing
      C(r, q) in (6.5.11) are aCi ar = 0 and aCI aq ~ O. These equations reduce, respectively, to

                                            C(r)      = C(r + q)                             (6.5.13)

                                            C(r,   q) ~ C(r + q)                             (6.5.14)

      Figure 6.5.5 illustrates the idea: (6.5.13) says, for any fixed q, set r to equalize C(r) and
      C(r + q). So, on the graph of C(s), these two points have equal heights and can be con­
      nccted by a horizontal line. (By the convexity of C(s), this implies r ==; s* ==; r + q. which
      proves (6.5.5).) Let H = H(q) denote this common height.
          With r chosen to satisfy (6.5.13), the shaded area A ~ A(q) is given by
                                     A(q) ~ qC(r    + q)      - f;+q C(s) ds

                                           = qC(r + q)        - [qC(r, q) - kA]
      (This A is umelated to the stockout probability A.) The second optimality condition
      (6.5.14) is thus equivalent to
                                                   A(q)   ~   kA                             (6.5.15)

      Conceptually, we can determine q* by manipulating the horizontal line defining f!,
      adjusting it up or down, until the shaded area equals kA.
          Let H +(q) denote the analogue of H(q) and A +(q) that of A(q), using C+(s) instead
      of C(s). Suppose we start with some q, and then increase it by the small amount dq. Then.

                    Hincreases by dH = H'(q) dq, and H+ by dH+ ~ H~(q) dq. Straightforward geometry

      6.5.4.2 Discussion
      Evidently, Algorithm Optimize_rq starts with g ~ I and successively increments g until
      g* is found. It is quite efficient when g* happens to be relatively small, but when g* is
      large, it may require a good deal of time. The algorithm can be extended, however, to
      start with any policy:
           For instance, by analogy to the continuous model, a plausible initial value for g is
      g" rounded to an integer. A plausible,. is an integer near s* - ~g, for some ~ between             6.6 LumpJ

      \\ and I - w.
           Given an initial policy, first find r*(g) for the initial g. This can be done with a sim­
      ple search procedure based on the ideas above. Then, determine whether to increase or
      decrease g by comparing Cq + I to C*(g). If Cq + 1 < C*(g), then g < g*, so proceed with
      Algorithm Optimize_rq, beginning with step 3. Otherwise, if Cq + 1 ;" C*(g), then
      g ;" g*. It is not hard to modify the algorithm to decrease g until g* is found. (Problem
      6.21 asks you to work out the details.)
           It is worth mentioning that the results above and Algorithm Optimize_rq do not re­
      ally require C(s) to be convex. The key property is that -C(s) be unimodal (i.e., C(s) is
      nonincreasing for s < s* and nondecreasing for s ~ s*).
           On the other hand, the algorithm is not guaranteed to work if there is a penalty cost
      on A instead ofB. (As discussed in Section 3.3.7, this is a peculiar objective, and it leads
      to peculiar results in the deterministic case.) In this case, the average cost can still be rep­
      resented in the form (6.5.16), where C(s) is redefined as
                                C(s) ~ hIes)   + bA(s)
                                      = h[s - v   + GI(s)] + bGo(s - I)
      Now, -C(s) happens to be unimodal when D has a Poisson distribution, and in that case
      the algorithm works. In general, however, - C(s) need not be unimodal. (One occasion­
      ally finds suggestions to the contrary in the literature; beware!) Without that property, it
      is much harder to find an optimal policy.

      6.5.5 A Service-Level Constraint
      Now, suppose there is an upper limit 1 - w_ on .4 instead of a backorder cost b. Also,
      k > 0, and both rand g are variables to be determined. The cost now includes only the
      firsttwo terms of(6.5.1), C(r, g) = kOF(r, g) + hI(r, g). The problem is to minimize this
      C(r, g), subject to A(r, g) :s I - w ..
            rn general, this is a hard problem. As mentioned in Section 6.2.3.3, for fixed g, it is
      easy to find the best r (namely, the smallest feasible value). Finding g*, however, re­
      quires a full search.
            Here is a heuristic: Set b ~ hw./(l - w.), so that w = bl(b + h) ~ w., replace k
      by k/w_, and minimize the original C(l; g) of (6.5.1) with no constraint, as above. This
      approach is relatively easy, and it works, in the sense that the resulting policy (r, g) has
      A near 1 - ClL. (This is easiest to see for a continuous approximation, in which case
      A ~ I - w. exactly. See Problem 6.17.)
            On the other hand, there is no guarantee that this policy minimizes the true cost.
      Still, the policy is likely to perform fairly well. (For the deterministic case of Sec­
                                                                                                                                 .

                              may insist on all or nothing. This second scenario leads to a far more complex model,
                              however, and only rarely to fundamentally different system behavior.) Moreover, the cus­

           As Chapter 9 shows, under staodard cost assunlptions, the best (r, s) policy is in fact
      optimal. This is not true of (r, q) policies. As noted above, there are special situations
      where ao (r, q) policy is preferred, but otherwise, in general, an (r, s) policy performs bet­
      ter. However, the best (I; q) policy is often close to optimal.
           The program here is the same as before: First, we evaluate the performance mea­
      sures   )f. B, 7,   and of. Then, we compute an optimal policy within each of the two pol­
      icy classes, As we shall see, much of the earlier analysis for pure Poisson demand car­
      ries over to this model.


      6.6.2 Policy Evaluation
      To analyze perfonnance, we follow the same four steps as in Section 6.2.3: Describe the
      distribution of IP; characterize the relationship between IP and D; determine the distri­
      bution ofIN; finally. compute J.. B, 7, and OF from IN
           There are two kinds of policies, and we perform the first step (describe IP) sepa­
      rately for each type. lbis is the only point where the two policy classes differ. The re­
      maining steps cover both types at once.
          Step I; Begin with the second class, the (r, q) policies. The result is precisely the
      same as for the pure Poisson-demand case: The limiting inventory position IP has the
      uniform distribution on the integers in the interval [r + I, r + ql
           The argument follows the proof of Lemma 6.2. I: Again, define IP,(t) = (r + q) ­
      IP(t). Ignore traosient states, i.e., assume 0 :s IPeeO) < q. The process IP, is a continuous­
      time Markov chain. It changes only at demand epochs, and if t is such a time, then
                                      !P,(t)     ~    [IP,(t-)     + Y] mod (q)
      Now, it is not hard to show that (Ilq)e', the uniform probability vector, is stationary for
      IP,. (This is basically the assertion of Problem 6.5, which is used in the proof of Theo­
      rem 6.3.2.) Also, the assumption that gy(l) > 0 ensures that!P, is irreducible. Conse­
      quently, IP, is uniformly distributed on the integers mod (q), aod IP is uniform on the
      integers in the interval [r + 1, r + q].
           Now, consider an (r, s) policy. The distribution of IP is more complex here, but still
      fairly simple. Define the following sequence recursively:
                                           rno   ~    0
                                           TnI' =
                                             .        1 + 2.{=1 gy(i)m.j -   i    j ~ 1

      (This is the discrete renewal Junction corresponding to gy.) Define q               ~   s -   r,   and let   L

      be the q-vector with components
                                             (m   +
                                               1 --­      -   mJ
                                       ,
                                      L · =l - -                      O:Si<q
                                                      nl q

      Then, Pr {IP ~ i} = L,_,. (Here, IP does depend on gy.)
         To see this, define IP, as before, with IPeCt) = (r + q) - IP(t) = s - IP(t). At a
      demand epoch t

                        IP,(t) =       I:een

      Here, OF is less than in the first interpretation.
          Next, consider an (r, s) policy. Applying (6.6.1),

      These formulas are not as simple as those for an (r, q) policy, but neither are they overly
      complex. Notice., A is a weighted average over q values of GO(d - 1), where d ranges
      from r + I to I' + q, but the weights are no longer equal. Likewise, B is an unequally
      weighted average of q values of C l

                                      6.6.3 Optimization
                                      Now, suppose we impose cost factors k, h, andp on the performance measures VF, 7 and
                                      E, respectively. Denote the total average cost by C(r, q) or C(r, s), depending on the pol­
                                      icy class. We wish to minimize C within each class.
                                            First, consider (/; q) policies. Here, B and 1 have the same form as in the Poisson­
                                      demand case. Nso, assuming each basic batch counts as an order, OF ~ AE[Y]/q too has
                                      the same form as before. Therefore, C(r, q) is precisely the function in (6.5.1) (with
                                      AE[Y] replacing \.) All the methods, formulas and bounds of Section 6.5 thus apply di­
                                      rectly. (The second interpretation of an order, comprising all basic batches ordered to­
                                      gether, requires more intricate methods; see Zheng and Chen [1992].)
                                            Turning next to (r, s) policies, things are not quite so straightforward. It is possible to
                                      construct a continuous approxinlation of C(r, s), but this does not help much. (The result­

                                      crete time, underlies the models of Chapter 9, and we shall cover some of these concepts

                 over all possible scenarios, and call this the expected present value for the chosen pol­
                 icy. When the cash flows are expressed as costs, as they are here, call the result the ex­
                 pected discounted cost.
                      In the stochastic context this is not the only possible criterion. (See Singhal [1988],
                 for instance.) It is the simplest one, however, and it is employed far more than any other.
                      We restrict attention to the model of Section 6.2.2: Demand is a Poisson process,
                 and k = 0, so we follow a base-stock policy. As in Section 3.7. a denotes the interest rate.
                                                                         °
                 Also, for now, suppose the system starts at time t = with no inventory and no orders
                 outstanding.
                      We first evaluate the expected discounted order cost With k = 0 there remains only
                 the variable order cost, e. Interpret this as a purchase cost, and assume (reasonably) that
                 we pay for goods when we receive them, after the leadtime, not when the order is placed.
                 The policy orders s units at time t ~ 0, and we receive them at time t = L. so the dis­
                 counted initial order cost is e-oLcs. From then on we order a llllit each time a demand
                 occurs. One can show that the expected discounted value of these continuing costs is
                 e-aLe(A!a).
                      Next, consider holding and hackorder costs. (The cost factors h and b include only
                 the real, physical costs!l and Q. not financing costs, as discussed in Section 3.7.) There
                 is nothing we can do to influence the initial costs during the time interval [0, L], sO ig­
                 nore them. Second, assume the discounted expected costs of this type can be calculated
                 as follows: For each time t ~ L, determine the expected rate at which cost is incurred;
                 then, discount this quantity (multiply bye-a,) and integrate over ( (Technically. we are
                 interchanging an expectation with an integral.) Now, following the derivations in Sec­
                 tion 6.2 and Section 6.5, this expected cost rate is precisely CCs) for t > L The overall
                 holding-backorder cost is thus   rz   e -a,C(s) dt = (e -aL!a)CCS).
                      We should also accollllt for delays in receiving revenues due to backorders, as in Prob­
                 lem 3.27. But this involves complexities that we prefer to skip. (Section 9.4.7 works out
                 the details for the discrete-time case.) So, assume that each customer pays us at his demand
                 epoch, even if the demand is hacklogged. (The cost Q above can include a penalty that we
                 pay continuously to each customer whose demand is backlogged.) Letting p denote the
                 sales price, the total expected discollllted revenue is pA/a. a constant which we omit.

                      Combining these results, the total expected discounted cost is

                      Now, let us optimize, as in Section 6.5. Suppose we use a continuous approxima­
                 tion. Differentiating Cars), we obtain the following equation for s':
                                                         o   h + ac

                 This has precisely the same form as (6.5.3); only the cost ratio is different For small a.

      Cw(s), independently of the others. Each of these one-dimensional problems can be
      solved using the methods of Section 6.5. Let s + denote the resulting vector of base-stock
      levels. Tbis is called the myopic policy for this model, because it optimizes the expected
      cost rate, looking ahead one leadtime into the future, ignoring all subsequent costs.
             The myopic policy is a useful benchmark even when it is suboptimal. It tends to be
      close to optimal, when the conditionalleadtime demand. is fairly insensitive to the start­
      ing condition W(O) = w, so the       s:are close together. Otherwise, it may perform poorly.
      Even then, it is related to the true optimal policy, which we denote s*. As we shall see in
      Section 9.7. it is always true that s* :5. s +, and the shape of s* (the way its components
      vary with w) is roughly parallel to that of s+.
             The quantity C(s +) provides a lower bound on the average cost of any policy, and
      hence on the actual optimal cost: This is the cost we would obtain, if at each time t we
      could resetIP(t) ~ s~V)' to achieve the best possible cost rate as measured by CW(o' Such
      actions may not be feasible, but certainly no policy could do better.
             Of course, the cost of the best base-stock policy (using a constant base-stock level),
      which we still denote by C*, is an upper bound on the true optimal cost. Thus, c* ­
      C(s +) provides an estimate of the cost savings from using current information about ~
      or in other words l an estimate of the value of such information. This approximation is
      not always accurate (if anything, it overestimates the true savings or value), but it is
      vastly simpler than any more refined estimate.
             Let us combine this approach with the normal approximation. Specifically, for each
      ~:'. use a normal distribution with mean V w and variance      a:,
                                                                      to approximate (Dlw). Also,
      let v be the column-vector (vw)w' and (7 = ("wk. From the results of Section 6.5.2, the
      myopic policy is determined by s:. = V w + z*cr w for each lv. (Recall, z* is a function only
      of the cost parameters, and so is independent of w.) Also, Cw(s:) = a w(b + h)<j>(z*).
      Thus, C(s+) = (~(7)(b + h)<j>(z*), and
                                       C* - C(S +) ~ (" - ~(7)(b       + h)<j>(z*)
      This is a remarkably simple formula. Indeed, taking C* as the base case, the (approxi­
      mate) relative cost is C(s +)/C* ~(7/", which is completely independent of the cost pa­

           Let us examine this ratio: Observe, cr~ is the variance of the leadtime demand as­
      suming we know W begins with W(O) ~ w. On the other hand, ,,' is the leadtirne-demand
      variance presuming nO knowledge of the initial state (beyond ~ itself). Because cr2 in­
      cludes this additional source of uncertainty. we expect cr to be larger than the cr w' at least
      on average. Indeed, decompose cr2 using the conditional-variance formula:
                        c? ~   V[D]

                            = EwV[Dlw]          +   VwE[Dlw]

      Notice, INhas the same form as IN in (6.2.3); only the leadtime-demand variable is dif­

Problems

6.1	 Consider the model of Section 6.2.2: Demand is a Poisson process, and we follow a base-stock
     policy. OUf customers, however, inform us in advance of their demands by the constant time LD ; in
     other words, customers order units from us for later delivery. (They will not accept early deliveries.)

                                                                                                                            useJ~
      Thus, the customer orders themselves form a Poisson proeess, and the actual demands describe the
      same process shifted forward in time by LD.
           First, assume LD ~ 1. Argue that, in this case, we can operate a perfect flow system, meeting

      every demand as it occurs while carrying no inventory at all.

           Now, assume L D < L. Let us slightly alter the meaning of a base-stock policy: Supposing we                     .......l

       convex function of the continuous variables (r, q). (Since I(r, q) is justB(I; q) plus a linear function    ~;

6.16   Within the proof of Theorem 6.5.1 there is a geometric argument that 0:0; H'(q) :0; hw. Here, we
       substantiate this result more rigorously.
           Let r(q) denote the optimal value of I' for fixed q, that is, the r which satisfies (6.5.13). By the
       chain rule, H(q) ~ C'(r(q))r'(q). Now, differentiate (6.5.13) with respect to q, and use the implicit       IbIS
       function theorem, to obtain an expression for r'(q). Then, use the inequalities -b :0; C'(r(q)) :0; 0             m.
       and 0 :0; C'(r(q) + q):o; h to argue that 0:0; H(q) :0; hw.
6.17   For the continuous (r, q) model of Section 6.5.3, show that the optimality condition (6.5.13) is
       equivalent to A(r, q) ~ I - w. Thus, as in the base-stock model, the optimal policy sets the
       stockout frequency to I - w.                                                                                leI

                     7.1 Introduction
                                7.1.1 Discussion
                                The previous chapter examined several stochastic demand processes, but only the sim­
                                plest type of supply process, where every order leadtime is the constant L. In reality,
                                leadtimes are rarely constant; unpredictable events in the supply system cause unpre­
                                dictable delays.
                                     The impact ofleadtime uncertainty, it turns out, depends on the structure ofthe sup­
                                ply system and how it operates. In certain special cases, surprisingly, leadtime uncer­
                                tainty has essentially no effect and can be ignored Most often, however, leadtime fluc­
                                tuations strongly degrade perfonnance, just as demand uncertainty does. Furthennore,
                                when the capacity of the supply system is limited, demand uncertainty induces longer
                                and more variable leadtimes; in other words, limited capacity magnifies the impact of
                                demand uncertainty.

                Unpredictable events in the supply system can also generate quality defects. We
           learned in Chapter 3 that imperfect quality can hurt performance even in a completely
           deterministic system. Unpredictable qualIty has even more pronounced effects, espe­
           cially in conjunction with stochastic demands and leadtimes. In limited-capacity sys­
           tems, moreover, defects waste capacity, thus amplifying the effects of the other sources
           of uncertainty.
                Even with these additional complicating features, the performance measures in
           many cases have the same form as in Chapter 6. Consequently, the optimization meth­
           ods of Section 6.5 can be applied once again. Also, the impact ofleadtime uncertainty
           and imperfect quality, as well as demand uncertainty, can be captured by tbe summary
           measure IT, suitably redefined.


           7.1.2 Taxonomy
           A supply system consists of production and transportation operations. We use the
           generic term processors to describe the individual operations. The system may be sim­
           ple or complex; it may be part of our organization, or a different firm.
                 We focus on three distinct supply-system structures. These emphasize different
           characteristics of real systems. All are abstractions to some degree; real supply systems
           are often hybrids of these types, and include additional eomplicating features. To make
           sense of more complex systems, however, it is essential to understand these fundamen­
           tal structures thoroughly.
                 Section 7.2 explores parallel processing systems: There is an infinite number of
           identical processors, which work independently. Each of our orders is handled by a dif­
           ferent processor. The time a processor requires to process an order is, in general, sto­
           chastic. So, the order leadtimes are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
           variables. Clearly, such a system has no capacity limits. The constant-Ieadtime system
           of Chapter 6 is the special case with deterministie processing times.
                 It turns out that leadtime uncertainty has relatively little impact in a parallel supply
           system. Farone special case (Poisson demand, a base-stock policy), indeed, performance
           is entirely insensitive to the leadtime distribution; the system is essentially equivalent to
           one with constant leadtimes. This is not SO in general; for world-driven demand and/or
           an (1; q) policy, leadtime uncertainty does have an effect. Even ~O, this effect is not as
           strong as in other stnlctures.
                 Section 7.3 treats limited-capacity supply systems. The simplest has a single proces­
           sor, capable of working on one order at a time. More complex systems have several (but
           still finitely many) processors arranged in series, or in parallel, or in more intricate net­
           works.
                 Limited capacity in conjunction with stochastic demand leads to congestion, and
           this in turn both increases order leadtimes and makes them less predictable. These con­
           gestion phenomena have dramatic effects on system behavior and. performance, alto­
           gether missing in a pure parallel system. This impact is strongest and clearest in a se­
           quential system, which preserves the sequence that orders arrive in. This category
           includes single-processor and series systems.

                       Processing systems by themselves are commonly used to represent the delivery ofserv­
                  ices. In the production-transportation context, a pure processing system models a service­
                  like product. The outputs are typically customized; each unit has specific features ordered

    maybe sim­    and each customer waits until his order is completed. TIus is called a make-la-order system.
                       Here, the processing system is part of a larger make-ta-stock system, which can cre­
iize different    ate goods and store them in anticipation of demand, in order to reduce customer waiting.
pply systems      Processing is triggered by orders, not demands. Clearly, this makes sense only if the

           And, of course, OF = A.
               Consequently, many ofthe qualitative results ofChapter 6 remain valid. For instance,
           Jj is decreasing and convex in s, while Tis increasing and convex, In a cost-minimization
           setting, therefore, the optimality condition (6.5.4) remains valid, and the optimal base­
           stock level essentially sets the backorder probability GO(s) to the critical ratio I - w.
                To understand the overall inventory system, therefore, we need to understand the
            supply system, no more and no less. For this purpose, we can and do apply the results of
          . queueing theory. However, we need to understand the system quite thoroughly; the mean
            occupancy E[10] is not enough. As the results of Chapter 6 suggest, we need either the
            full distribution of10, or perhaps an approximation based on V[10] as well as E[10].
                 Next. consider an (r, q) policy with q > 1. Conceptually at least, the same basic idea
            applies. However, the input to the supply system is no longer a copy of the demand
            process, but rather a filtered version ofit. Consequently, the calculation of10 can be far
            more difficult. We shall see some cases where 10 can be determined exactly and others
           where it can be approximated accurately.
                This is thc analytical approach used in most of the next two sections. Section 7.4,
           however, uses a different approach, more reminiscent of Section 6.2.3. There the focus
           shifts to the time an order spends in the supply system, instead of the occupancy.



7.2 Independent, Stochastic Leadtimes
           This section explores supply systems with a parallel-processing structure. There is an in­
           finite number of identical, independent processors. Each order is handled by a different
           processor. So, when two or more orders are in the system, they are processed simulta­
           neously, without interacting in any way. The time required to process an order is, in gen­
           eral, stochastic. So, the order leadtimes are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.)
           random variables. Let L denote a generic random variable with this common distribu­
           tion; the mean leadtime is then E[L].
                In the standard code ofqueues, this is a -IGloo system. The 00 indicates an infinite num­
           ber of parallel servers, the G stands for general independent service times, and the· means
           the input is yet to be specified. When we connect this system to the rest oflhe model, the
           input will be precisely the process describing orders, which depends on the demand
           process and the policy.
                Of course, no real supply system has infinite processing capacity. The model is an
           approximation, a limiting case of systems with considerable, though finite, parallel
           structure, where the capacity limit is reached only rarely. The model gives a fairly accu­
           rate account, qualitatively and quantitatively, of the behavior of such systems.

                    7.2.1 Poisson Demand, Base-Stock Policy
                    Suppose that demand is a Poisson process. Consider a base-stock policy with base-stock
                    level s 2" 0, and assume IN(O) ~ 1(0) ~ IP(O) ~ S. SO, the input (order) process is iden­
                    tical to the Poisson demand process. The code for the supply system is M/G/oo (the M

           The performance of selected base-stock policies is as follows:

      21        0.44       134          2.34

      32        0.01      0.01         12.01


      So, to meet the performance target, the company should set s = 28. With this policy, the average
      inventory of loaners will be about 8. The normal approximation prescribes
      s = 27.36. Rounding this up to 28, the approximation predicts A = 0.037 and! = 8.07, quite close
      to the exact values.
            By the way, while leadtime variation itself does not affect the result, the company can stilt
      gain by reducing the times of the longest jobs, for that will reduce E[L].
            The calculations above, and those of the other examples in this chapter, were performed in a
      simple spreadsheet, using the formulas in the tcxt You might want to set up your own spreadsheet
      to verify the results and cxplore the effects of parameter changes.

      EXAMPLE 7.2.B, PART 1
      Reconsider the classical record store of Example 6.2.A in Chapter 6. The leadtime there was the
      constant 0.5. but now suppose that it is really stochastic with E[L] = 0.5. Nevertheless, for a par­
      allel supply system. the results are precisely the same as before.


      7.2.2 World-Driven Demand
      Next, consider a world-driven demand process, as in Section 6.3, still assuming a base­
      stock policy. It is difficult to obtain the exact distribution of 10, and even when it is pos­
      sible, the calculations are rather complex.
           Fortunately, the normal approximation of [0 works well, provided AE[L] is fairly
      large.. (Indeed, the approximation approaches the exact distribution in the limit, in a cer­
      tain sense, as AE[L] --> 00. Such a result is called a heavy-traffic approximation.) The nor­
      mal parameters are
                            v    ~   AE[L]     (J2 ~ AE[L]   + A(1jJ2 -   I)E[L[21]                (7.2.1)

                     Here, til is the asymptotic variance-to-mean ratio of the demand process, and L[l] indi­
                     cates a random variable, the minimum of two independent copies of L. That is, L[2] =
                     min {L~ L 1 }, where L 1 and L 1 are ij.d. random variables, each with the same distribu­
                     tion as L. We shall say more about L[2] in a moment.
                          For a Poisson process, of course, til = 1, so (f2 reduces to the correct value, AE[L].
                     For 1Ji2 ,.. I, think of ,,2 the base value )Ji[L] plus a correction factor. The sign of this
                     correction factor depends on (1Ji2 - I), which is a characteristic of the demand process;
                     it does not depend on L. Thus, according to the approximation, 10 is more variable than
                     in the Poisson case «(fl > v), precisely when demand is more variable than a Poisson
                     process. The magnitude of the correction factor depends on the deviation of 1Ji2 from I,
                     but also on E[L[2]]' which reflects the distribution of L.
                          For constant L, E[L[2]] ~ E[L] ~ L, so ,,2 ~ 1Ji2v,. The approximation is thus con­
                     sistent with that of Section 6.4. In general, 0 < E[L[21] s E[L], and it is not hard to show
                     that
                                                    E[L] - E[L[2]] = »E[       ILl - L 21 ]
                     Thus, E[L] - E[L[2]] is a measure of the variation of L. If the distribution of L is spread
                     out widely, this quantity is large. For example, if L has a unifonn distribution on the in­

                     For most ofthis chapter, as in Chapter 6, stockouts lead to backorders. Now, consider the
                     lost-sales case: A demand that cannot be met immediately is lost forever (as in Sec­

      where g denotes the Poisson pmf with mean v and G the corresponding cdf. So, glO is
      just a truncated version ofg. Again, 10 depends on the distribution of L only through its
      mean.
           The stockout probability is A = gIO(S), so the rate at which lost sales occur is
      'AgIO(s), and OF = 'A(l - A) = 'A[l - gIO(S)]. The average inventory is
                               1 ~ Ij=o (s - 1)glO(J)          ~ S -   v   + vglO(s)
            These criteria have fundamentally different forms than in the backorders model.
      Still, A is decreasing and convex in s, and lis increasing and convex. (See Problem 7.2.)
      So, given a service-level target or cost factors on .Ii and 1, it is not hard to determine the
      optimal base-stock level.

                  enth!), according to a Poisson process. The mean leadtime is 2 weeks (also the same). The store
                  aims to fill about 80% of demands directly from stock. Customers who cannot find the album in
                  stock, however, walk out angrily and purchase it at a competing store across town.
                       Again, the average leadtime demand is n = (3.6)(0.5) = 1.8. Direct calculation yields the per­
                  formance of alternative base-stock policies:

                  6           0.01      4.21


                  (Comparing this to the table in Example 6.2.A, Part 1, for each value ofs, A is smaller and-j larger
                  than in the backlog case.) With a performance target of A :::;; 1 - w_ = 0.2, the store should set
                  s = 3. (Recall, in the backlog case, the sameperlormance target requireds = 4.) This policy leads
                  to an average inventory of 1.52.
                       By the way, you might question the 80% service target. A lost sale usually (very likely in this
                  case) has a greater economic impact than a backorder. So, perhaps the popular store should aim

                  higher, say at 95%.

                      Thcse results apply in particular to the constant-Ieadtime system. We remarked in
                  Section 6.2 that, for this system, assuming backorders, a base-stock policy is really op­
                  timal. This is not so in the lost-sales case. A base-stock policy is a useful heuristic, but
                  no more than that. (Section 9.6.5 of Chapter 9 explains.)

lies occur is           We need to specify precisely what happens to the individual units in a batch. Do they
                  become separate entities in the supply system, or is the batch processed as a whole? In the
                  first case, do we receive completed units immediately, or must we wait until the whole

                        Here, assume the simplest scenario, like that of Section 6.2: The supply system
                  treats the batch as a whole, and the order leadtime is a random variable L, which does
                  not depend on q. Even then, exact analysis is difficult. Here is an approximation, using
 its venerable    the nonnal approximation of Section 7.2.2 within Section 6.4.3's evaluation scheme for
thoven's Sev­     (r, q) policies:
252   Foundations ofIrrvent01Y Management


           First, focus on the supply system: It treats each order as a distinct unit. LetIO(t) =
      IO(t)/q denote the supply system's occupancy in these units, i.e., the ml111ber of orders
      outstanding. An order is placed every q demands, so the input to the supply system is a
      renewal process, where each interdemand time has an Erlang-q distribution. This is an
      MCDC process; IP plays the role ofW. Clearly, the input rate is:i. = A/q, and it is not
      hard to show that the variance-mean ratio is ~2 ~ I/q. So, as in Section 7.2.2, for large
      A, the limiting occupancy TO is approximately normal, with parameters
                                  £[10]     ~ :I.£[L]


                                  v[10] ~ :i.£[L] + :i.(~2 - I)E[L[2]]

      Consequently, 10 =      qIO too is approximately normal with parameters
                          v = qE[ID] = AE[L]                                                     (7.2.2)

                          (J2 = q2V[IO] = AE[L]          + A(q   - I)(£[L] - £[L[21])
          Now, IP has the uniform distribution on the integers in [r          + 1, r + q], and we can
      approximate this by the continuous uniform distribution on [r, r        + q], as in Section 6.4.3.
      Also,
                                                IN=IP - IO
      However, IP and 10 arc not independent. As a further approximation. let us treat them as
      such. (More precisely, use (J2 above to estimate V[IN] - V[IP] = V[IO] - 2V[IP, 10],
      where V[Ip, 10] means the covariance of IP andIO. Itturns out that the error thus introduced
      is negligible for large A.) Given all these approximations, formulas (6.4.9) to (6.4.11) can
      be used directly to estimate performance. This approach works well when AE[L] is large.
           The expression for v is the same as in the constant-Ieadtime case, but (]"2 is quite dif·
      ferent. Recall, £[L] - £[L[2]] measures leadtime variation. So, when q > I, in sharp con­
      trast to the case of q = 1, leadtime variation does affect (]"2 and hence system perfor­
      mance. The larger q is, the greater this impact is. Thus, the batch size and leadtime
      variation have a joint effect on performance.
           Actually, (7.2.2) tends to overestimate V[IN] - V[IP] for large q, and the follow­
      ing refinement works better:
                       (I2   ~ AE[L]   + min                                    2
                                                (A(q - I)(£[L] - E[L[2]])' A V[L]}               (7.2.3)
      (The second term in the minimum also appears in the analysis of sequential supply sys­
      tems. as in Section 7.5.3. It arises here because, when q is large, there is rarely more than
      one order outstanding, so the supply system behaves almost sequentially.) This formula
      too expresses a joint effect of q and leadtime variation, but a limited one.
           The optimization results of Section 6.5 do not apply straightforwardly here, because
      the performance formulas (6.4.9) to (6.4.11) depend on q directly, but also indirectly
      through <T. It remains true that, for fixed q, the formulas depend on r in the same way as
      before. For instance,B and 7 are convex in 1'; so it is easy to minimize the average cost over
      r for fixed q; moreover, the optimal cost includes a term that is roughly proportional to <T.
      But, for variable q as well as 1'; the optimality behavior ofthis system is uncharted territory.

nd the follow­       Return once more to the case of Poisson demand and q = I. Suppose that the supply sys­
                     tem occasionally produces a defective unit. Each arriving unit has probability 8 of being
                     defective, independent of the others. A defective unit is entirely useless and must be dis­
          (7.2.3)
                     carded. Assume we discover defects immediately. This scenario is similar to that of Sec­
ial supply sys­      tion 3.6 of Chapter 3. There, however, defects were predictable. Here, although 8 is still
rely more than       the long-run fraction of defects, we do not know whether a unit is defective or not until
) This fonmula       it actually arrives; quality is uncertain as well as imperfect.
                          Consider what happens when a unit arrives and is found defective: The order for that
 here, because       unit has failed, in effect, so it makes sense to order another one immediately. When that
also indirectly      second unit arrives, it too may turn out defective. If so, place yet another order. This se­
e same way as        quence of events continues until we finally receive a nondefective unit. (This rule is a
mtge cost over       base-stock policy; it keeps fP(t) constant. It is a reasonable heuristic, but even in the
portional to (T.     constant-Ieadrime case, it is not optimal overall. See Section 9.4.8 and Section 9.6.7 of
arted territory.     Chapter 9.)
254   Foundations oflm'entory Management


           Call L the nominal leadtime, the time required for the supply system to deliver a
      unit, regardless ofquality. Define L I to be the time needed to deliver a nondefective unit,
      the actual effective leadtime. The effective leadtimes for different orders are indepen­
      dent, so the system operates just like one with perfect quality, but with L' replacing L.
           For simplicity, suppose also that the nominalleadtimes within an effective leadtime
      are independent. The random variable L' thus has a compound distribution, based on that
      of L. But, by the results of Section 7.2.1, only the mean counts, and this is given by

                                             E[L'] ~ E[L]
                                                         ~
      where ~ ~ I - o. The effect of imperfect quality, then, is an inflation of the mean ef­
      fective leadtime. Under the TIonnal or maximal approximation, (J" grows by a factor of
       I/~, and performance deteriorates accordingly.
           Imperfect quality also affects the cost parameters, depending on the payment
      arrangements. The required adjustments are the same as in Section 3.6. (It is possible,
      but much harder, to analyze the second inspection scheme of Section 3.6, where defects
      are discovered only when units are given to customers in response to their demands. Sec­
      tion 7.3.5.3 considers this scheme in the context of a different supply system.)
           Finally, assume a constant leadtirneL, and consider a general (r, q) policy. Here, an ar­
      riving batch may include both defective and nondefective units. Thus, the effects of poor
      quality cannot be captured exactly by an inflated leadtirne, as above. That approach seems
      to work fairly well as an approximation, however (see Moinzadeh and Lee [1987]): That is,
      replace L by the constant L' = LI~, and then apply the calculations of Section 6.2.3.

      7.2.7 Processing Networks
      Suppose that the supply system consists of several stages or nodes, each a parallel­
      processing system like those above. The nodes are indexedj = I, ... ,J Each order must
      pass through the nodes in this order, from 1 to J. Thus, the nodes are arranged in series,
      and we call the network a series system. (Unlike the series systems of Chapter 5, how­
      ever, the supply system is a pure make-ta-order system; there are no inventories of semi­
      finished goods at the nodes. Chapter 8 considers stochastic systems with internal inven­
      tories.) The processing time at node j is the random variable £)" These times are
      independent of one another, both within each node and across nodes.
           The totalleadtime for each order is the random variable L ~ Ij Lj . Each order's lead­
      time, moreover, is independent of those of other orders. So, this system reduces to a
      single-node parallel supply system like those above.
           It is worth mentioning one additional fact: Assume Poisson demand and a base­
      stock policy. Let fOj denote the equilibrium occupancy of node j. Then, fOj has the Pois­
      son distribution with mean AE[LJ, and these random variables are independent. (This is
      consistent with what we already know, namely, that fO = ~ fOj has the Poisson distri­
      bution with mean AE[L].) Section 8.3.4.4 of Chapter 8 uses this fact.
           These results extend to more complex network structures, where the processing se­
      quence is not fixed: Suppose that each order starts at a randomly chosen node. Subse­
      quently, on completing processing at node i, the order moves next to node j with same

;tern to deliver a    fixed probability, and exits the supply system (arrives in our inventory) with some other
ondefective unit,     probability. So, anyone order might encOlmter the same node several times, and other
ers are indepen­      nodes not at all. Assume that every order does exit eventually. (In queueing-theory par­

; is given by         moving from i to j, and riO the probability of exiting the system from i. These are called
                      routing probabilities. The movements of orders in the network are independent of the
                      processing times, and each such event is independent of the others.
                              These routing probabilities can be interpreted as quality defect rates. Suppose that
of the mean ef­       the normal processing sequence, when all goes well, is nodes 1,2, ... , J, as in the se­

7.3 Limited-Capacity Supply Systems
           7.3.1 Discllssion
           This section considers supply systems with limited capacity to process orders. The theory
           of queues covers a huge variety ofsuch systems, ahnost any of which can serve as the sup­
           ply system in a larger make-ta-stock inventory system. Here, we discuss only a few impor­
           tant ones. Also, we omit the technicalities of the theory, concentrating on its main results.
                The central insight of queueing theory is that limited capacity and variation to­
           gether cause congestion: Consider a processing system that can process work at some
           finite rate. Suppose it receives an input stream that fluctuates over time. During a period
           when the input surges, the system experiences a short-term capacity shortage, and a
           backlog of work builds up. Even after the input subsides, it takes a while to work offthe
           backlog. Greater and/or more frequent surges cause more such congestion. Variation in
           processing capacity, due to occasional breakdowns or other factors, increases congestion
           in the same way. All this is true even if the system's capacity is adequate to process its
           workload in the long run.
                Let p represent the ratio of the long-run average workload-arrival rate to the aver­
           age processing capacity. (These notions are a bit vague, but never mind; they will be
           quite precise later on.) So, "adequate capacity" certainly means p oS 1. It turns out that
           system stability actually requires p < I. This expresses another key insight: III a system
           with input or processing variation, excess capacity is necessary for stability. Moreover,
           the congestion in the system and its performance "explode" (become worse without
           limit) as p approaches I. In fact, tbe totalleadtime experienced by arriving units includes
           a term proportional to p/(l - p).
                All this describes a stand-alone processing system, but the results are equally im­
           portant for a make-to-stock system. The supply system must have excess capacity, and
           performance depends critically on p. The results below illustrate this clearly.


           7.3.2 One Processor, Poisson Demand, Base-Stock Policy
           Most of this section assumes Poisson demand and a base-stock policy. So, starting with
           1(0) ~ IP(O) ~ s, the input to the supply system is itself a Poisson process. Sections 7.3.8
           and 7.3.9 consider other demand processes and policies.
                This subsection, and severa] others below, treat the case of a single processor. The
           processor works on its inputs (orders) whenever there are inputs to work on, i.e., when
           IO(t) > 0, shutting offonly when there are none. It processes orders sequentially, in their
           order of arrival. Systems with multiple processors are discussed later.

           7.3.2.1 Markovian Processing
           Suppose that, while the processor operates, it completes units according to a Poisson
           process with rate fL, the processing rate. This implies (Section C.5.6) that the unit pro­
           cessing times are independent and exponentially distributed with mean 1/f.L. In this case,
           fL represents the capacity of the system, and p = A/fL. Assume p < I. so the system is

                     stable. The code for this processing system is MlMII. (Both Ms stand for Markovian; the
                     second one refers to the assumptions above about processing.)
                           Markovian processing means a great deal of variation. The exponential distribu­

     7.3.2.2 General Processing TImes

     Now, suppose the processing times are still i.i.d., but have an arbitrary distribution. The

     code for this processing system is M/GIl. Let S denote the generic processing-time ran­

     dom variable. Assume that E[S], E[S2], and E[S3] are finite. Again, denote I-' ~ IIE[S]

     and p = All-', and assume p < 1.

          There is no simple formula for g, the pmf of 10, but it can be computed by a recur­
     sive procedure: Let gD(S) denote the pmf of D(S), the demand during a random time in­
     terval S, and GZ(S) its ccdf. (Usually, gDiS) can be derived or computed easily.) Then,
                                 g(O) = I - p

     From g, the ccdf GO and the loss function G' can be obtained directly. (In a moment we
     shall see an explicit formula for a special case.)
          There are closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the order waiting
     time, the time an order spends waiting for access to the processor before its own pro­
     cessing begins, denoted L Q :

      These moments can be used to approximate the distribution of 10.
           The formulas clearly reveal the impact of the system parameters on L Q and hence
      on Land 10: In (7.3.2), the term 1/fJ. = E[S] is a scale factor; the rest ofthe formula ex­
      presses E[LQl as a multiple of E[S]. The utilization p again plays a dominant role through
      p/(l - p); as p approaches 1, E[LQl explodes. Processing variation has a linear impact
      via the term Y:(I + 1jJ~). These factors also affect V[LQl in (7.3.3) through the E 1[LQl
      term. The additional component of V[L Q ] is similar in fonn, but it expresses processing
      variation by the third-moment factor iOfJ. 3E[S3].

      When Sis exponential, 1jJ~= I and fJ.3E [S3] = 6, and we recover the results above for the
      MIMII system. Most production processes have values of 1jJ1 between 0 and 1.
          Now, suppose that S has a CPR distribution (Section C.5.5) with parameters ("" M),
      where,..... is a row-vector and M a square matrix. Assume .....e = 1, so the unit processing
      time is positive with probability I. Recall, M- I 2" 0, and E[S] = 1/fJ. = ",/r.1 'e.
          In this case, L too has a CPR distribution. Its parameters are (v, N), where
                            v = ",[(I - p)I         + Mil]                     N   ~   M - Ae",
      (Actually, N need not have all the required properties for a CPR distribution. Neverthe­
      less, the distribution of L follows the CPR form.) Also, for P ~ A(AI + N) - I and
      'IT = vp, 10 has a DPR distribution (Section Co404) with parameters ('IT, Pl. Therefore,

      Notice the formal similarity between (7.304) and (7.3.1); the matrix P plays the same
      role here as the scalar p above. (Section Co4o4 discusses the implementation of calcu­
      lations of this sort.)

                     Next, consider a variant of the MIMIl system, where the processing rate j.L depends on
                     the current occupancy of the system. Specifically, when JO(t) = i, the processiog rate
                     becomes iLi- For example, the supply system may work faster when its workload grows
                     large, in which case J..Li increases in i.

                     From this, GO and G' can be computed directly. Problem 7.4 presents a special case.


                     7.3.3.2 Multiple Processors

                     Here is another special case: Reconsider the independent-Ieadtime model of Sec­ 

 above for the

nit processing            This agrees with the earlier result. What is interesting is the following alternative in­

O\nere               there is a single processor, whose processing rate grows linearly with IO(t). The process
                     10 is precisely the same as before, so 10 is also, even though the order leadtimes are cer­
                     tainly not independent. Thus, the result of Section 7.2.1 depends less on the indepen­

      So, g(i) looks like a Poisson pmf for i :s m, and a geometric poo for i > m. The system
      combines features of the MIMlI and MlMloo systems, and so does its solution.
      EXAMPLE 7.3.A, PART 2
      Suppose the computer-repair company has 15 technicians. The processing rate is now !-L = 1.1731,
      so that v = 13.639, p = 0.9093, andE[IO] is about 20 as before. Theperfonnance of selected base­
      stock policies is as fcHows:


      ,        A          Jj              I
      39      0.065       1.30      20.30

      40      0.059       1.18      21.18

      41      0.054       1.07          22.07

      42      0.049      0.97       22.97

      43      0.044      0.89       23.89

      44      0.040      0.81       24.81

      45      0.037      0.73       25.73



      To meet the requirement of A ~ 0.05, the company should set s = 42, between the values (28 and
      62) of the pure parallel and sequential systems. This policy has average inventory about 23, also
      between the values for those two systems.

      7.3.3.3 Finite Sources of Demand
      Now, return to the case of a constant processing rate. Suppose that there is a finite num­
      ber of potential customers, say n, and when a customer's demand is backordered that
      customer makes no further demands. Here is an example: The customers are pieces of
      equipment, say aircraft or machine tools, and a demand occurs when a critical part fails
      on one of them. The inventory is a stock of spare parts. The supply process is a repair
      system. When a demand is backordered, then the corresponding machine cannot oper­
      ate, and hence cannot generate subsequent demands.
           Again, 10 is a birth-death process, but now the demand rate depends on the current
      state. Specifically, suppose each customer has demand rate Aln. so the total demand rate
      when there are no backorders is just A. In general, when 10(1) ~ i, the demand rate be­
      comes
                                                A                        i~s

                       7.3.4 Lost Sales
now fL   ~   1.1731,
:of selected base-     Consider a lost-sales system like that of Section 7.2.3, but with only one processor. The
                       processing times are exponentially distributed with mean II..... and set p = A/fL. (It is /lot
                       necessary to assume p < I; because ofthe lost-sales feature, this system is stable for any
                       p 2: 0.)
                            Now, 10 behaves like a single-processor system with a finite occupancy limit;
                       IO(t) ~ s precisely when l(t) ~ 0, in which case arrivals (demands) are lost. The code
                       for this system is MIMII/s. Its solution is simple. (You can verify it yourself: 10 is a
                       finite-state birth-death process, as discussed in Section C.SA.)

                       Return to the MIMII system with backorders. Suppose now that each unit, on complet­ 

                       ing processing, turns out to be defective with probability o. Aside from the different sup­

                       ply system, the scenario is the same as in Section 7.2.6. This model is a stochastic ana­ 

                       logue of the finite-capacity deterministic model of Section 3.6.3 in Chapter 3. For now,

                       assume we inspect each unit on receipt and discard the defectives. Again, ~ = I - o.

                            While the processor is working, the output of nondefective units is a thinned Pois­

      processing rate. The system is thus identical to one with perfect quality but this slower
      processing rate. AlI the results of Section 7.3.2.1 apply, with p = il./(l;fL).
           Just as in the deterministic model, defects waste production capacity. If the defect
      rate is too high, an otherwise stable system can be rendered lffistable. Within the range
      of stability, however, the effects of poor quality are more significant than in the deter­
      ministic case. For example, the quantity p/(1 - p) now becomes il./(l;fL - iI.), which is
      very sensitive even to small 8 if J.L is near A.. The stochastic elements of the system, in­
      cluding quality itself, amplify the impact of bad quality. Also, the effects are stronger
      here than in the uncapacitated system of Section 7.2.6. Poor quality has the greatest im­
      pact in the presence of both uncertainty and limited capacity.

      7.3.5.2 General Processing Times
      These effects are even more pronounced in a supply system which, were it not for qual­
      ity problems, would perfonn more reliably than the MlMII system. Consider an MlGII
      system with generic processing time S. Now, producing a defective unit has the same ef­
      fect as requiring that unit to repeat the processing operation. Thus (using the same logic
      as in Section 7.2.6), the effective processing time is a new random variable S', where

      Referring to (7.3.2), & affects fL and p just as in the MlMII case, but there is an addi­

      fects can induce variability in the processing times. This effect is absent in the MIMI!

                                            ~ I there. (Problem 7.11 obtains sharper results for
      the case where S has a CPH distribution.)

      7.3.5.3 Delayed Inspection
      Returning to the MIMII model, consider the postponed-inspection scenario of Section 3.6
      (cases 3 and 4), where defects are discovered only when units are given to customers; units
      are inspected, in effect, by the customers themselves. When a demand occurs, withdraw a
      unit from inventory, and inspect it; if it is defective, discard it, and withdraw another unit,
      and so forth. It is possible that the entire inventory turns out defective, in which case the
      demand must be backlogged. When there are backorders outstanding and a unit arrives
      from the supply system, inspection occurs instantaneously, as before.
           Compared to the immediate-inspection case, this one requires a more elaborate
      analysis (Problem 7.12). The results, however, are simple and intriguing: Setting p+ =
      1 - (1 - p)l;,

                              - (p)

                      Now, suppose the supply system is a network of J nodes. The initial node and movements

e it not for qual­    between nodes are governed by routing probabilities '"ij' just as in Section 7.2.7. Again,

has the same ef­      gle processor that operates like the ·/MII system above. Let fLj be the processing rate for

g the same logic      node j. (The imperfect-quality system of Section 7.3.5.1 with immediate inspection is

Lble SI, where        the special case with J = 1.) This model is called a Jackson network, after its inventor,

                      Jackson [1957,1963],

                            Assume that the matrix 1 - R is nonsingular, so the network is open! and every or­
                      der ultimately leaves it. Equation (7.2.4) then gives the total input rates Aj . Set Pj = A/fLJ'
                      and assume too that Pj < I for all}, so the capacity of each node is adequate to process
                      its input.
                            As in Section 7.2.7, the equilibrium occupancies 10) are independent. Here. how­

tlere is an addi­     independent, geometrically distributed random variables. Consequently, [0 has a DPH

      7.3.6.2 Constant Processing Times

      Now, consider a series system where the processing time S,i at node} is the constant l/f-l;­

      Let S* = max {S; : I <; j <; J], and consider an MlGIl system with processing time S·

      and input rate A. 'It turns out that the total order-waiting time L Q is precisely the same in

      the series system and in this MIGll system. So, L here is simply the sum of all the pro­ 

      cessing times S ~ 4j Sj ~ 4j (lIfL), plus L Q in the MlG/I system. Section 7.3.8 explains

      how to use this fact to compute the distribution of10.

           Letj* indicate any node for which Sj' = S·. We callj* a bottleneck. The bottlenecks
      determine L Q. [fwe remove one of the other nodes, L is reduced by that node's process­
      ing time, but L Q remains unaffected. Only if we remove all bottlenecks is L Q itself
      reduced. Such behavior is quite different from the Markovian network above, where each
      node's contribution to L is independent of the others, and the removal of any node re­
      duces waiting as well as processing time.

      7.3.6.3 More Complex Networks

      Certain more general networks also have simple solutions, for instance, when each node

      has several identical Markovian processors working in parallel, as in Section 7.3.3.2. Un­ 

      fortunately. other important models do not. Even for a series system with nonexponen­ 

      tial and nonconstant processing times, it is generally impossible to obtain the exact dis­

      tribution of 10. (Approximations have been developed; see the Notes.)

            Another important but problematic model is afinite-buffer series system: Imagine
      each node's queue occupying a physical storage area, or buffer, oflimited capacity. When
      the buffer is full, the prior node is blocked; it is unable or forbidden to process any units,
      even if there are some available in its own queue. Even with exponential processing
      times, it is difficult to determine whether such a system is stable, let alone its perfor­
      mance characteristics. (Again, approximations are available; see the Notes.)


      7.3.7 Multiple Input Sources
      Consider any of the systems above. Suppose that, in addition to OUT orders, the supply
      system has to process other work. This forms another Poisson process with rate 'A', in­
      dependent of OUT orders. Assume that all units have the same processing-time distribu­
      tion and otherwise are treated identically.
            The overall input to the supply system is then a Poisson process with rate 1.+ = A +
      A'. Suppose we can compute the pmfg +0 ofthe total number ofunits in the system,IO+.
                                                                e
      [t turns out that each unit in the system has probability = 1.11.+ of being one of OUT or­
      ders, independently of the identities of the other units. Therefore, the conditional distribu­
      tion 01'10, given 10+ = n, is binomial with parameters (n, e). Deconditioning on 10 yields

                             g(i)   ~ 4;~t)e'(l    -   er'g+(n)        i   ~   0

      This technique is called binomial disaggregation.
           For example, in the MIMII system with service rate fL, 10+ has the geometric distri­
      bution with parameter p+ = A+/fL, as shown above. A simple calculation shows that 10 is
      also geometric withpararneter p ~ AI[A + (fL - A+)J and mean p/(l - p) = A/(fL - 1.+).

                       Notice the crucial difference between a sequential system and the paraJlel~processing
                       system of Section 7.2.2, both assuming Poisson demand: There, V[IO] = E[/O] =
                       AE[L]; the second term in V[IO] above is absent. In a sequential system, however, the
                       variance of the leadtime does play an important role. (Here, of course, L is not specified

      model with equal values of E[L], the sequential model will always produce larger values
      of lJ, and hence J, for all s. (See Problem 7.6. Figure 7.3.1 above illustrates this fact. Sec­
      tion 7.5 further explores the effects of V[L] on performance.)

      cases, including the MlO/l system with CPH processing times and the series network

      7.3.9 World-Driven Demand
      When we relax the Poisson-demand assumption, there are basically four possibilities:
      First, for very special cases) there are simple, exact results. This is so, for instance, for
      GlfMll systems, where demand is a renewal process, and there is a single Markovian
      processor. Second, for a somewhat broader range of systems, it is possible to compute
      the distribution of10 numerically. There is an algorithm to solve the general MCDCIMII
      system, for example. Such specialized results and methods, while interesting and useful,
      are too special or too complex for us to cover here. Third, one can estimate performance
      via computer simulation.
           Fourth, there are reasonably accurate approximations for a still broader class of sys­
      tems. These are appropriate when we want to see the general pattern of system behavior,
      and so are willing to forego total precision. Consider a ·/011 supply system and a world­
      driven demand process, letting ~~ denote its variance/mean ratio. The following is a use­
      ful approximation for E[Ld:

                                  E[Ld     ~ ~ (~1 + ~})C ~ p)(~:)                            (7.3.6)

      Notice, (7.3.2) is identical to (7.3.6) with ~1 ~ I, so this approximation agrees with the
      exact result for the M/OIl system. In general, the term y,(~1 + ~}) represents an over­

      also works for lumpy demand, assuming each unit is processed individually, as in Sec­

           The approximation works especially well when p is large. In fact, this is a heavy­
      traffic approximation. The true value and (7.3.6) agree in the limit (in a certain sense) as
      p --> 1. Even for moderate p, the approximation often works well, though not always.

      and Sobel [1982], for example.)

      processing times, the processor turns on and off at the same times, and IN is the same
      in the two cases. The order stream carries essentially the same information as the di­
      rect production signals.
             Now, consider a more general policy: There are two policy variables, r and s, where
      r < s. Suppose the system starts at time 0 with IN(O) ~ s and the processor off. Nothing
      happens until IN(t) hits r. At that moment we tum the processor on. When IN(I) hits s,
      we tum the processor off. Now the system is back at the starting point, and we continue
      in the same manner.
             This policy makes sense when there is a setup cost to start (and/or a shutdown cost
      to stop) production, or simply a cost to send a signal of either kind. Increasing the range
      s -	 r means that such costs are incurred less frequently. In this sense the policy is sim­
      ilar in spint to an (r, q) policy; it exploits scale economies. (Ifs ~ r + I, clearly, the pol­
      icy reduces to a base-stock policy.) As we shall see, however, this direct-control system
      is considerably easier to analyze than a standard order-transfer system.
             Call this an (r, s) policy. (The same notation is used for a related policy in Sec­
      tion 6.6.) The model is a stochastic version of the detenninistic limited-capacity models
      of Chapter 3, Section 3.4.
             As in Section 7.1, define 10(1) = s - IN(I), and call 10 the occupancy of the sup­
      ply system. Again, 10 does not depend on the particular values of rand s, but it does de­
      pend on the difference s - r, denoted by q. (Of course, q is not the batch size here. In­
      deed, q is the minimal number of units produced during a run; more units may be needed
      to compensate for demands occurring during the run.) Also, let X (capital X) be the sto­
      chastic process indicating whether the processor is on or off; X(t) = I means on, while
      X( I)	 = 0 means off.
             Now, assume that in all other ways the system functions just like the MIM/l system
      above: Demand is Poisson, and the unit processing times are exponentially distributed.
      Problem 7.7 asks you to demonstrate that the joint process (10, X) is a continuous-time
      Markov chain and to derive its stationary distribution. Specifically, letting gU, X) ~ Pr

                           vex in I: Also, the algorithm of Section 6.504 finds a cost-minimizing policy, and, up to
                           a continuous approximation (see below), the bounds of Section 6.5.3 remain valid.


                           7.3.11 The ExpollentialApproximation
                           Recall, the normal approximation of 10 works well for a constant-Ieadtime supply sys­
                           tem, and more generally, for an independent-leadtime system. Perusing the results of this
272   Foundations ojlnvent01y ManagellJenj


      section, it is evident that the exponential distribution plays a similar role for limited­
      capacity systems:

           For the world-driven-demand, single-processor system of Section 7.3.9, the distri­

      bution of 10 is approximately exponential for large p. Geometric distributions appear in

      several places, and a geometric distribution has essentially the same shape as an expo­
      nential. In other places, 10 has a DPH distributIon, and the tail of a DPH distribution is

      approximately geometric, hence exponential. (For a Markovian network, in fact, GO(i)

      = p'+l for large i, where p ~ max {p).) Finally, for the (1; s) policy of Section 7.3.10.2,

      the performance formulas look like those of Chapter 6 for an (r, q) policy, but using a

      geometric or DPH distribution, again essentially exponential in form.
           Thus, the exponential distribution captures the basic, qualitative behavior of a

      limited-capacity system. That distribution has only one parameter, its mean v = E[!Oj.

      To estimate it, we need some information about the supply and demand processes, but
      not all that much. For a single-processor system, for instance, we may use (7.3.7). In

      most cases, v is nearly proportional to 11(1 - pl. Also, the standard deviation is a = v.

          The performance measures for a base-stock policy are given in Section 6.4.2, but

      we repeat them here for convenience:

                                A(s)   ~ FO(s) =    e -;Iv
                                B(s) ~ FI(s) = ve-;/v

                                I(s) ~ s - v      + B(s) = v(~ -   I   + e -;Iv)
                                                             V                                                      I

      So, to meet a target value 1 - w_ for A, set s ~ [-In (l - w_)]v. In that case, I ~
                   -----..J
      [-In (l - w_) - w_]v. For average-cost minimization, following the approach of Sec­

      tion 6.5.2,

                                       s*    ~   -In(l- w)v
                                       C* = hs*     ~   h[-ln(l- w)]v
           Let us examine the behavior of these formulas and compare them with those for the

      normal approximation. Since 0" = v, it is clear that 0" plays essentially the same role in both

      cases. It is a scale factor in the ratio s/O", and it multipliesB, 7, s*, and C*. So again! 0" is a

      key determinant of system performance; the original system parameters (p,     !jib. !jIl,     etc.)
      affect performance through 0".
           However, a reflects limited capacity, mainly through the explosive factor 1/(l - p),
      an effect absent in a parallel-processing system. Also, given two systems with Poisson

      demand and equal v, one parallel and one sequential, 0" is different in the two cases;

      a = '.(v for the parallel system, but a ~ v in the sequential case. In general, the expo­
      nential approximation and the finite-capacity supply systems it describes do not exhibit

      statistical economies ofscale. For instance, if (7.3.7) is used, 0" includes a term propor­

      tional to the demand-variance ratio 4Jb. not its square root. Likewise, 0" grows at least as

      fast as A, not \lA,   even ignoring the factor 1/(1 - pl. That factor, of course, grows hy­
      perbolically in A, indicating strong diseconomies of scale.

           In other words, while the benefits of system-improvement efforts can still be esti­

      mated through a, those benefits are quite different here, and usually greater, than with a

                                This section presents a different type of supply system. Here are some examples to mo­ 

                                tivate the idea:

 So again, (T is a              simplicity, suppose this network is sequential; it delivers our orders in the same sequence as
(p,   lJJi"lJJ1,
             etc.)              they are placed. Having read Section 7.3.6, we could create a network model ofthe kind dis­
                                cussed there to represent the supplier. The manufacturer doubtless has many other cus­

l the two cases;
                                that they capture the dynamic effects of orders on the supply system. Each order's lead­
oeral, the expo­                time depends on the congestion it finds in the supply system, which in turn depends on

urse, grows hy­                 time, our demands and orders contribute little to these fluctuations. We can thus reason­
                                ably approximate the supplier's network as exogenous, ignoring the effect of our orders.
:an still be esti­              As we shall see, this means we can do without much of the fine detail of a processing­
lter, than with a               network mode!.

           Here is another example: Suppose leadtimes represent travel times. When we place
      an order, the corresponding goods are loaded onto a vehicle, say a truck, a train, or a ship.
      The vehicle then travels to us, over a highway, a track, or an ocean. The vehicles are iden­
      tical for all orders, and they all follow the same route. The transit times can vary, how­
      ever, because of local traffic eonditions, switch failures, the weather, and so forth. Now,
      suppose that the traffic our vehicles add to the overall load on the transport system is
      negligible. Thus, we can again think of the supply system as exogenous. Also, suppose
      that none of our vehicles ever passes another, so the system is sequential.
           These examples emphasize the two key properties of the systems considered here:
      The starting point is an exogenous supply system, whose evolution is independent of our
      demands and orders; the operation of this system determines OUf leadtimes. This system
      is sequential, so our orders do not cross in time. In practical tenus, the difference be­
      tween this scenario and the prior section's is one of scale. We are assuming, in effect, that
      the supply system is large relative to our operations. Of course, no real supply system is
      truly exogenous; like the parallel supply system of Section 7.2, this model is a limiting
      case, but a useful one.
      EXAMPLE 7.4.A
      A Japanese trading company purchases hardwoods from an intemationallumber company and dis­
      tributes them to furniture makers throughout Japan. The supplier harvests logs in Southeast Asia,
      processes them into lumber, and ships them all over the world. For each of its major markets, in­
      cluding Japan, it fills orders in sequence. Although the trading company is large, it is only one
      among many customers of the lumber company. Thus, from the trading company's viewpoint, the
      supply system is essentially exogenous.

           The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to apply essentially the same
      methodology used in Section 6.3 for the case of constant leadtimes. In particular, we can
      easily evaluate perfonnance for any world-driven demand process using any (r, q) pol­
      icy. This is in sharp contrast to the other stochastic-Ieadtime systems above, where non­
      Poisson demands or large batch sizes complicate matters significantly. Furthennore, the
      optimization methods and results of Section 6.5 all apply.

      7.4.1.2 Formulation

      We now describe the supply system in fonnal tenns: The core of the model is a Markov

      process Z ~ {Z(t) : t 2: A}, which describes the state of the supply system. In addition,

      there is a stochastic process L = {L(t) : t 2: A}, which depends on Z in a quasi-Markov

      way: For each t, given Z(t), the distribution of L(t) depends on Z(u) only for u 2: t. not

      u < t. That is, conditional on Z(t), L(t) is independent of the past of Z, but certain com­ 

      mon events may affectL(t) and the future ofZ. Moreover, the joint process (Z, L) is well­

      behaved, in the sense of Section 6.2.1; it is ergodic and has a limiting distribution, rep­ 

      resented by the random variable (2; L).

            For each t, L(t) is a scalar with 0 :=; L(t) < 00. We call L(t) the virtualleadtime attime
      t. If an order is placed at time t, its leadtime is L(t); however, L(t) is defined for all t.
            Two additional assrunptions are needed. First, (Z, L) is entirely independent of D;
      this is what exogenous means. Second, t + L(t) is nondecreasing in t, which ensures that
      orders do not cross in time, i.e., the supply system is sequential.

nthermore, the        variable Z(t) describes the current occupancy of each node (the exogenous analogue of
                      the vector [I0/tn in Section 7.3.6). This Z is indeed a Markov process, specifically, a
                      continuous-time Markov chain.

            These models may seem complex. Fortunately, we need them for conceptual pur­
       poses only In the end, as we shan see, the performance of the system depends only on
       the distribution of L. For instance, although the original (Z, L) above and the workload
       formulation are different stochastic processes, they have the same equilibrium Ieadtime
      L, and that's what counts. (Incidentally, the workload formulation can be extended to a
      more general network, where the processing times have general distributions, and these
      times are independent over units.)
           Here is a slight variation: Suppose Z(r) includes, in addition to the information
      above, the procesl'ing times of the next unit to arrive. So, when a unit arrives, it inherits
      those processing times, and determines the following unit's times. Let L(t) be the time
      until that next unit would depart, ifit arrived at time t. 0'le may call this L(I) the virtual
      sojourn time.) Here, provided the processing times are always positive, so arc L(t) and
      1. This is more realistic in most situations. Assuming markovian processing, in fact, L
      has the same distribution as L= in Section 7.3.6, i.e., a simple CPH distribution.
           By the way, you might expect that observation of Z(t) should affect our order deci­
      sions. Indeed it should. Tlie slory here is parallel to Section 6.3, where a world variable
      Wet) drives demand: Assume that we do not have, or cannot use? current infonnation
      about the supply system in the replenishment policy. When the supply syslem is some
      large network whose operations we cannot see, as in the examples above, this assump­
      tion makes perfect sense. So, it is reasonable to use a simple base-stock or (r, q) policy,
      depending on scale economies in supply, as before.

      PROOF.            All and only those orders placed at time t or before arrive at or before time
      t + L(t).
            Now, consider a world-driven demand process satisfying the assumption of Sec­
       tion n..n . Thus, Lemma 6.3.1 describes the limiting distribution of (IP, Wi, and for any
      fixed leadtime, Theorem 6.3.2 describes the limiting distribution of IN in terms of the
       leadtimc demand.
            For the actual stochastic-leadtime system, define the leadtime demand as the ran­
       dom variable D = D(L). That is, start the processes (W, D) and (Z, L) in equilibrium at
       time 0, and observe the demand over the random time L = 1.(0). Let g(dlt) denote the
       pmf of D( t), i.e., the leadtime demand for a constant leadtime t. Then, the pmf of Dis

      That is, D is a mixture of the D(t) over t, Idting t be distributed as L.
          We now show that the analogue ofTheorem 6.3.2 describes IN in this case:

           The same approach works for lumpy demand, say a compoWld-Poisson process. The re­
      sults are identical to those of Section 6.6, depending on the policy, with D = D(L), as above.

      7.4.3 (Approximate) Extensions
      Although these results are more general than the two prior sections', the approach is
      somewhat inflexible. It cannot be extended easily to a lost-sales system, and imperfect
      quality also becomes problematic.

      7.4.3.1 Lost Sales

      Consider a lost-sales system. Reviewing the analysis above, troubles begin immediately:

      Lemma 7.4.1 no longer holds, because lost demands do not reduce the net inventory. The

      demand process effectively ceases to operate when IN(t) ~ O. Since the rest of the analy­

      sis builds on the lemma, the entire approach breaks down. (The same is true of any sys­

      tem whose effective demand process, describing the demands actually filled, depends on

      the current value of IN(t), including the finite-source demand model of Section 7.3.3.3.)

           Here is an approximation, inspired by the results ofthe previous two sections: First, con­

                                      Which ofthese approximations works better? We know of no concrete evidence. We
                                 expect the first to be more accurate when q is small relative to r, and the second when q
                                 is relatively large.

                                 Thus, the two components IN(t) and IO(t) of IP(t) measure different things. We canl/ot
                                 simply add them to form IP(t).
                                      We do not yet know how to resolve this dilemma. For the constant-Ieadtime system,
                                 Section 7.2 provides exact (for q = I) and approximate (for q > I) methods. Chapter 9
                                 presents a quite different approach. Perhaps these techniques can be adapted to cover the

                                 This section continues the study of exogenous, sequential supply systems, focusing on
                                 computational issues. Given D and L, what is the distribution of D? And, knowing 0, can
                                 we efficiently compute its loss functions C 1 and C 2 ? We focus on a few specific cases.
                                     Section 7.5.3 discusses certain approximations, and Section 7.5.4 treats the lumpy­
                                 demand case. All proofs are collected in Section 7.5.5.

 there is never                  First, assume that D is a Poisson process. Since 0 = D(L), a formula like (6.2.16) de­

                                 In addition, (6.2.16) itself characterizes the relation between Band BW
                                      We consider two particular leadtime distributions:

                                 7.5.1.1 Gamma Leadtime
                                 First, suppose that L has a ganuna distribution (Section C.2.5.3). There are two parameters,
                                 f), and n. both positive numbers. E[L] ~ I//f), and V[L] ~ nlf),'. The Laplace transform is

                                 requires estimates ofE[L] and V[L] to fit f), and 11, but no more information than thaI.)

           Apply (7.5.1) to obtain

                                           g(z) =   (I-P)"
                                                    I - pz

      where p ~ AI(A + fl.). Consulting Section C.2.3.6, we see that the leadtime demand has
      the negative-binomial distribution with parameters p and n. Section Co2.3.6 also shows
      how to compute the pmf and the loss functions.
      EXAMPLE 7.5.A
      The hardwood distributor of Examplc 7.4.A estimates the average leadtime for shipments ofma­
      hogany to beE[L] = 1.5 months, with a variance of V[L] = 0.75 months2 . Demand for mahogany
      is a Poisson process of rate A = 8 (hundred board-meters/month). The supplier accepts orders only
      in units of5 (hundred board-meters). The cost of holding inventory is h = 1 (thousand ¥/[(hoo­
      dred board-meters)-monthD, and the backorder penalty cost is b = 9 (in the same units). Since q
      = 5 is fixed, there is no need to include the order cost.
            Use a gamma distribution to approximate L. Thus, fJ, ~ E[L]IV[L] ~ 1.5/0.75 ~ 2 and n ~
      ~[L] = 2(1.5) = 3. Thus, D has the negative-binomial distribution with parameters n = 0.75 and
      p = 8/(8 + 2) = 0.8. Using the negative-binomial formulas in Section C.1.3.6 within the per­
      formance measures of Section 7.4.2, we obtain the costs (in thousand ¥/month) of alternative (r,
      q) policies for q = 5:


      ,.        e(r, q)

      25        18.42




      Evidently, r = 19 or 20 yields the lowest cost.
            Let us explore the effects ofleadtime variance on performance in this case. Figure 7.5.1
      displays the results for A ~ 10, E[L J ~ 1, and four values of V[L]. Evidently, performance
      deteriorates as the variance increases; in other words, there are real benefits to be gained by
      reducing leadtime variation.
            For n = 1, the negative binomial reduces to a geometric distribution. This form ap­
      pears too in the multiple-source system of Section 7.3.7, and it is worthwhile to compare
      the two cases. Here,p lies between 0 and I for any A > 0, because E[L] ~ 1/fJ, is speci­
      fied exogenously. There, the corresponding parameter is p ~ A/[A + (fJ, - A+)J ~
      A/(fJ, - A'), where fJ, is tbe processing rate, A' the arrival rate from otber sources, and

                        Next. suppose L has a (continuous) phase-type, or CPH, distribution. Such a distribution
                        is specified by an m-vector J.L and an m X m matrix Iv/. Assume J.Le = 1 for simplicity,
                        so L has no mass at zero. (See Section C.5.5. As indicated there, some writers specify a
                        CPH distribution using -Min place of our M.) There is some overlap with the previous
                        model: An ErIang distribution, and in particular an exponential, is a special case of both

      THEOREM 7.5.1:          If demand is a Poisson process, and L has a CPH distribution, then
      D has a discrete phase-type (OPR) distribution (Section C.4.4) with parameters ('IT, P),
      where
                                       P   = A(H + M)-I           'IT   ~   ...p	         (7.5.2)

      (Problem 7.16 asks you to show that 'IT and P have the required properties.)
          The loss functions are given by
                                   GI(i)    = 'IT(1-   p)-IP'e	                           (7.5.3)

      Therefore, for an (r, q) policy with r 2 0,

                                           (1)

                                  A =	 1- 'IT(1 - P)-I(l - pq)P'e                         (7.5.5)

      Section C.4.4 explains how to evaluate such quantities. For a base-stock policy with
      q ~ I and s = r + I, these formulas reduce to

                                             A = ...P'e
                                             lJ =	 'IT(I-P)-lre
      We encountered essentially the same formulas in (7.3.4).
           Furthennore, using Theorem 6.2.4, we can fully describe the distribution of CliS­
      tomerwaiting times, BW' First, consider a base-stock policy with s ~ O. Given the form
                                                         t
      ofD, it follows immediately that B = [D - s has a OPH distribution with parameters
      ('IT?", Pl. Now, reverse the argument of Theorem 7.5.1, with B playing the role of D, to
      conclude that BWhas a CPH distribution with parameters ( ... p', M). Thus, the/orm of
      BW is precisely the same as that of L, and they even share the same matrix parameter M;
      only their vector parameters differ.
           For example, suppose L has an exponential distribution with parameter /-L; here,
      ... ~ (I) and M oc (11). Then, BWhas a delayed exponential distribution, in particular,
      F2w(t) = p'; e- "'. r > 0, where p = AI(A + 11).
           Similarly, for an (r, q) policy with r 2 0, BWhas a CPH distribution with matrix pa­
      rameter M and initial vector (l/q) ...P(1 - p)-I(I - pq)P'.


      7.5.2 World-Driven Demand
      Next, suppose that demand is an MCDC process, as in Section 6.3. It is driven by a
      Markov chain W with generator Q = QO - AD + A, where the matrix AD specifies the
      demand rates in all states. Again, ~ denotes the stationary vector of W.
          Recall, the distribution ofD is difficult to compute when the leadtime L is constant.
      Now, suppose L has a CPH distribution with parameters (..., M), where l1e ~ 1. With a
      stochastic leadtime of this fonn, D becomes relatively simple. Redefine

                      above, then D has the DPH distribution with parameters ('IT, Pl.
            (7.5.3)   The expressions for P and 1T generalize (7.5.2) for the Poisson-demand case. (There, Q
            (7.5.4)   becomes the I X 1 matrix (0), ~ ~ (1), and A ~ (A).) Thus, fonnulas (7.5.5) to (7.5.6)
                      for A andB apply immediately to this model. (Under a base-stock policy, BW again has
                      a CPH distribution with matrix parameter M. The initial vector now involves powers of
                      a larger matrix like R See Song and Zipkin [1992].)
            (7.5.5)        Evidently, the effort required to compute the performance measures depends on the
                      complexity of the demand and supply models, through the sizes of the matrices Q and
                      M. It is worth noting that, in the special case where demand is a renewal process, the cal­

                  eral, D has a compound distribution, built from those of jj and Y. Let us investigate the
                  form of D for a few specific cases.
                       First, suppose 15 has the Poisson distribution with mean v (as in a constant-Ieadtime
                  system), and y the logarithmic distribution with parameter p (Section C.2.3.7). Then,
                                                  gD(Z)    ~   exp {-v[1 - gy(z)]}

                                                           = exp {-v[1 -           In (I _ p)]}

                                                                  I _    p)n
                                                           = ( 1- zp

                  where n ~ v[ -I/ln (I - p)]. Thus, D                  has the negative-binomial distribution with
                  parameters nand p. (We know of no                     compelling motivation for the logarithmic
                  distribution, apart from this neat result.            It is merely a coincidence that the negative­
                  binomial distribution arises here and in              the very different models of Section 7.5.1.1
                  and Problem 7.4.)

          Next, suppose 15 has the OPR distribution with parameters (fr,P), and Y itself has
      a OPR distribution with parameters (0, 8). (Since gyrO) ~ 0, Oe ~ 1.) Then, D also has
      a OPR distribution with parameters ('IT, P), where
                            'IT=fr®O            P = f® 8      + l' ® [(I -    8)eO]
      (See Problem 7.20.) For example, suppose that Yhas a geometric distribution, shifted up
      by I so thatgy(O) = O. So, 0 and 8 are both I X I arrays, 0 = (I), and 8 = (8) for some
      scalar 8 with 0 < 8 < 1. In this case,
                                       17=fi'       P ~ 8f    + (I   - 8)1'
      The loss functions are given by (7.5.3) and (7.5.4). These can be used within the formu­
      las of Section 6.6 for ii, JJ, and J, depending on the type of policy used. For an (r, q) pol­
      icy, A andE are given by (7.5.5) and (7.5.6). (For an (r, s) policy, it is possible to com­
      pute ,explicitly.)
           In general, we can adapt the approximation of Section 7.5.3. Assuming compound­
      Poisson demand,
                                            E[l5] = AE[L]

                                            v[l5] = AE[L]   + A2V[L]
      and the formulas for compound distributions of Section C.2.3.8 yield
                                    E[D] = E[15]E[Y]

                                    V[D] = E[l5]V[Y]        + V[15]E2[y]
      Combining these two results gives
                                   E[D] = AE[Y]E[L]

                                   V[D] = AE[y2]E[L]        + (AE[y])2 V [L]
      We can use these moments to fit a convenient distribution, such as a negative binomial,
      a gamma, or a normal.
          This approach works approximately even when D is not a Poisson process. Starting
      with the approximation for v[l5] in (7.5.7), we obtain
                            E[D]   ~   AE[Y]E[L]                                             (7.5.8)

                            V[D] = A(V[Y]       +   ~2E2[Y])E[L]     + (AE[y])2 V [L]        (7.5.9)

      The term A(V[Y] + ~2E2[y]) in (7.5.9) represents the overall demand variation, as dis­
      cussed in Section 6.6.2; this quantity is scaled by the average leadtime. The term V[L]
      represents supply variation, which is scaled by the (squared) overall demand rate. The
      total variation in the system, V[D], summarizes the contributions from all these sources.

      PROOF OF THEOREM 7.5.2. We use an argument parallel to the second demon­
      stration of (7.5.10): Consider the joint process (D, W, U). Define
              gwu.w'u,(dlt)   ~   Pr {D(t)    ~      d, Wet)   ~   w', U(t) = u'IW(O) = w, U(O)   ~   u}

      (The matrix G(dll) has rows indexed by w and u, and columns indexed by w' and u'.
      Specifically, to index the rows, group together states with the same value of w, letting u
      vary over all the transient states of U; the columns are indexed similarly, by grouping
                                                                                                                     Notes
      states with a common Wi. As before, only transient states u and u' are included.)
           Now, W and U are independent Markov chains, so the generator of (W, U), restricted
      to the transient states of U, can be written in the form
                            QEB(-M)         ~    Q®I+I®(-M)                =   -(-QEBM)
      The dynamics of G(dll) can thus be represented as follows:
              G(OIO) = I® 1
              G(dIO)    ~ 0   ®0         d> 0

              G'(Olt) = -G(Olt)(A®I+ -QEBM)
              G'(dlt)   ~   -G(dlt)(A®I+ -QEBM) + G(d - Ilt)(A®l)                                 d> 0
      Defining the matrix z-transfonn (zit) as above, we obtain
                              G(zlt) ~ exp {-[(I - =)(A ® l) + -Q EB M]I}
      Now in tbis case, the quantity (!; ® ",)G(dlt)(e ® Me) describes jointly the probability
      that D(t) ~ d and the absorption rate of U. Thus,

                              g(d)   = .Io(!; ® ",)G(dlt)(e ® Me) dt
                                     = (!;®",)[J~G(dlt)dt](e®Me)

      (The last equation uses the fact that (-Q EB M)(e ® e) = -Qe ® e + e ®Me                     ~   e ®Me.)
      Thus,

           g(=)	 ~ (!; ® ",)[.10 G(zlt) dt]( -Q EB M)(e ® e)

8.1 Introduction
           The last two chapters focus on a single product at a single location. Now we shift atten­
           tion to structurally complex systems, as in Chapter 5, where several items (products
           and/or locations) are linked to form a network. In contrast to Chapter 5 (but as in Chap­
           ters 6 and 7) the demand process and the supply system may include random factors.
                Such a network is sometimes called a supply chain. There has been a surge of in­
           terest recently in supply-chain management, as many companies have realized substan­
           tial benefits by restructuring their supply chains. To do this, one must understand how
           alternative control schemes and system designs work. This chapter summarizes the best
           analytical tools available to support supply-chain management at this conceptual level.
                A supply chain is a type of business process. (This phrase also encompasses pure
           information-processing systems, where physical goods play a marginal role.)
           Business-process reengineering is a careful, systematic approach to network restruc­
           turing in order to enhance performance. Again, this chapter provides tools to support
           such endeavors.

296   Foundations a/Inventory Management

           We begin in Section 8.2 with a system composed of many independent items, each
      facing stochastic demand and supply conditions. The results generalize those of Sec­
      tion 5.2 of Chapter 5: We characterize overall system performance with the aid of a few
      simple aggregate statistics. These include the variety index J. and a systemwide index
      of variation (the cost-weighted sum ofthe items' individual <T's). These results allow us
      to measure precisely and to understand intuitively the benefits of item consolidation.
            The rest of the chapter treats systems whose items are linked, mainly through
      supply-demand relationships. We focus on a few special structures, namely, series,
      assembly, and distribution systems. Also, we discuss shared supply processes.
            One key distinction among such systems concerns the flow of information and con­
      trol. (We touched on this issue in Chapter 5, but here it becomes even more crucial.)
      When a structurally complex system is driven partly by random events, we need to un­
      derstand clearly just who knows what and when, and how that information is used to con­
      trol the various parts of the network.
            The simplest case, conceptually, is a centralized system. Here, all relevant information
      in the network flows to a single point, where all decisions are made. These decisions are then
      transmitted throughout the network to be implemented. In a sense this situation is ideal;
      what could be better than a fully informed decision Illilker with full control over the system?
          In practice, however (as mentioned in Section 5.8), centralization may be impracti­
      calor even dysfunctional: It requires a fast, reliable communication system, a powerful
      infonnation-processing capability. and an organization willing and able to act in syn­
      chronized fashion. For a host of technical. economic, and cultural reasons, these ele­
      ments are often lacking. To impose centralized control where it cannot be supported
      properly can have perverse effects.
          For this reason we also consider relatively decentralized systems, where infonnation
      and control are distributed throughout the network. We say "relatively" because, while
      the inforllliltional requirements of such systems are less formidable than those of a fully
      centralized system, they are fairly stiff all the same. There are many ways to decentral­
      ize, but not all of them work. For one thing, lacking a central authority, there must be
      some alternative mechanism to avoid chaos. All the control policies we consider are
      carefully sculpted to achieve reasonable degrees of coordination.
           Sometimes, there is a clear reason to centralize infonnation and control. Central­
      ization allows us to balance the items' inventories in situations where otherwise, under
      purely local control, imbalances would arise. The exact meaning of balance depends on
      the context, but this general notion is broadly valid.
           We begin with series systems in Section 8.3, focusing on those with no scale
      economies in supply. The root problem here, just as in a single-stage system, is the com­
      bination of demand uncertainty and supply leadtimes; again, this leads to a tradeoff be­
      tween inventory and backorders. But now we have several possible stocking points, of­
      fering different degrees of stockout protection at different costs. We must decide not just
      how much inventory to keep, but also where to position it.
           Interestingly, the distinction between centralized and decentralized systems disap­
      pears here. We start with a simple, plausible local control scheme, using a base-stock
      policy at each stage, and show that it is equivalent to a fully centralized system. Thus,
      centralized control can be implemented in a decentralized fashion.

    those of Sec­    the two-stage case we derive simple bounds on the optimal policy variables and the op­

~ul ts allow us           We obtain these results first for a basic model with Poisson demand and constant

ainly through        compound-Poisson demand and all the supply systems of Chapter 7.
amely, series,             Then, we consider a system with fix.ed order costs. We start with a simple case,
cesses.              where external orders incur fixed costs, but internal shipments do not. Most of the ear­
arion and con­       lier results extend directly to this system. Here, the first stage uses an (r, q) policy, while

                     decentralized control are not the same. (Actually, centralized control is more general.)

                     uate such a policy, again using series-systems techniques.

               We find that, in general, a system with centralized control needs less warehouse in­
          ventory than a local-control system. The centralized system is able to substitute infor­
          mation for inventory to achieve some degree of retailer consolidation.

          joint-replenishment problem. Then, we turn to systems with shared production capacity.
          These are similar, but not quite identical, to distribution systems. The section concludes
          with a general discussion of setup costs in systems with limited reSQurces.
               Finally, Section 8.8 explores variants of the base-stock policy for networks with
          limited-capacity processors. These policies are based on the celebrated kanban system.
          We find that, although these policies are more intricate than a base-stock policy, the sim­
          ple models of Section 8.3 capture the fundamental economics of the system. Then, we
          discuss these ideas in the broader context of the just-in-time approach to operations.


8.2 Independent Items
           Consider an inventory of several independent items, i.e., a parallel system, as in Sec­
           tion 5.2 of Chapter 5. Now, each item follows one ofthe scenarios of Chapters 6 and 7:
           Each faces a stochastic demand process and possibly also a stochastic supply system.
           The goal here, as in Section 5.2, is to understand aggregate-level system performance in
           terms of aggregate parameters. (You might want to review Section 5.2, which explains
           the uses of such aggregate-level analysis.)
                Again denote

               Cj    = purchase cost of item j

               Pi    ~   sales price of item}

           Use the total purchase-cost rate as an aggregate-demand statistic:

                                                     cA   = ~:.J c·A·

           8.2.1 Base-Stock Policies
           Suppose there are no scale economies in ordering, and we use a base-stock policy for
           each item. There are two primary performance criteria for each item, average inventory
           and average backorders. Accordingly, define two aggregate performance measures:
                                       cI = average total investment in inventory

                                         =;ci~
                                      pB = aggregate sales-value of backorders
                                         = 'iiPjBi
           where 1.J andBj denote average inventory and backorders of item j.

                    dependence is homogeneous; that is, cO" acts as a scale factor for both eI and cB.
                          Figure 8.2.1 shows one such tradeoff curve, computed using the normal approxi­

                    for eR, to show more clearly the impact of reducing eR to a very small value. This ap­
                    proach is similar to the stock-service tradeoff figures of Chapter 6, but at an aggregate

               With given cost factors the optimal cost here becomes
                                          C* = cA     + (cu )([3 + 'T])<P(z*)                      (8.2.3)

          Aside from the constant purchase cost cx., the total cost also is proportional to CIT.
               The aggregate parameter CIT, then, expresses the essential effect of multiple items,
          something like the variety index J. of Section 5.2. Specifically, we cannot predict per­
          formance solely on the basis of an aggregate-demand statistic such as cA. For example,
          if each item's demand process is Poisson, and all items share the common fixed leadtime
          L. then u j ~ V¥,    so cu = ('{i)'j;jc)~. To estimate performance, then, requires in­
          formation about the distribution of the 'Aj over the items. Again, because of the concav­
          ity of the square-root function, we expect a system with few items haviog large Aj to cost
          less than one with many low-demand items. (Remember, nevertheless, there may be
          solid marketing arguments for a differentiated product line.)
               This point is clearest in the case of identical items. Suppose we keep the total de­
          mand rate A constant, so cA is just the product of A and the (common) cost rate c. Each
          A} = )JJ. so u; = yUIJ and cu = cy JAIL. Thus, apart from the constant term CA, the
          total cost c* IS proportional to the square root of the number of items.


      4
          8,2,2 General (,; q) Policies
          Now, suppose there are scale economies in supply, and we follow an (r, q) policy for each
          item. We need another aggregate performance measure (first introduced in Section 5.2):
                                        wO   ~    aggregate average workload
                                             ~    2ywpFj
          Let us extend the individual-item approach above: Specify K, the unit cost of the re­
          sources measured in wO, and the cost factors
                                             k;   = KW;       j   ~   1, ... ,J
          io addition to 'T], [3, and the hj and bj defined in (8.2.1). Then, find the optimal (,; q) pol­
          icy for each item separately and combine the results to detennine an efficient point (cI,
          pB, wO). By repeatiog this process for different values of K/'T] and [3/'T], we can trace out
          an aggregate tradeoff surface, a two-dimensional surface in the three-space with coor­
          dinates (cI, pB, wO). This surface describes the best (smallest) possible value of anyone
          of the measures, given the values of the other two.
               Under the simplifying assumptions above, we obtain simpler results: Use the upper
          bound in (6.5.9) to approximate the optimal cost for each item. The (approximate) total
          cost becomes
                                             C* = I j [CjAj   + C oj + CkJ
          where

           Summing these terms yields
                                C* = CA     + c(T(fl + 'lj)<f>(z*) + y'2(K'ljw)(wcA)J,          (8.2.4)

           where J. is the variety index of Section 5.2.
               Here we see, in one line, all the significant detenninants of performance. The ag­
           gregate statistic err has a scaling effect on one of the terms, just as in the base-stock
           model abovel while the variety index plays the same role as in the detenninistic model
           of Section 5.2. In the identical-item case, J. = J, so again (apart from the constant cAl
           c* is proportional to   v7.

8.3 Series Systems
           8.3.1 Base-Stock Policy Evaluation: Poisson Demand, Constant Leadtimes
           Consider a series system, like that of Section 5.3: There are J stages. The numbering of
           stages follows the flow of goods. Stage I receives supplies from an outside source. All
           other links are internal; each stage j < J feeds its successor, stage j + I. Each stage has
           its own associated supply system. When stage j - I sends a shipment toward stage j (or
           the source sends a shipmentto stage j = I), the shipment must pass through stagej's sup­
           ply system before arriving at j. Every stage can hold inventory. Demand is stochastic; it
           occurs only at the last stage, J
                Until Section 8.3.4 we focus on the simplest case: Demand is a Poisson process
           with rate ft., and each stage j's supply system generates constant leadtimes, Lj. There
           are no scale economies in supply and consequently no incentives to batch orders or
           shipments.
                We shall consider natural extensions of the base-stock policy for a single stage. In
           a multistage system, there are two types of base-stock policy, local and echelon. As we
           shall see, although they seem quite different, they are equivalent in this context.
                A local base-stockpolicy is a decentralized control scheme, where each stage mon­
           itors its own local inventory position, places orders with its predecessor, and responds to
           orders from its successor. Each stage j follows a standard, single-stage base-stock policy
           with parameter
                                       s;
                                        = local base-stock level for stage j

           a non-negative integer. The overdll policy is described by the vector Sf = (SJ)j=l'
                 The policy works as follows: Stage J monitors its own inventory position. It expe­
           riences demands and places orders with stage J - I just like a single location operating
           alone, using a standard base-stock policy with base-stock level sj. Stage J - I treats
           these incoming orders as its own demands, filling them (releasing shipments, to arrive
           afier time L J) when it has stock available and otherwise logging backorders to be filled
           later. It too follows a standard base-stock policy with parameter sJ_ L to detennine the or­
           ders it places with stage J - 2. Stage J - 2 treats these orders as its demands, et cetera.
           Stage I's orders go to the external source, which fills them immediately, so they arrive
           at stage I after time L;.

                         Suppose that each stage starts with inventory si and an empty supply system. Then,
                    each customer demand at stage J immediately triggers a demand at stage J - I, which
           (8.24)
                    in turn generates a demand at stage J - 2, and so on. In this way demands propagate
                    backward through the system, all the way to the external source. Thus, every stage ex­

          Consider the look-ahead approach of Section 6.2.3: A direct conservation-of-flow
      argument, like that underlying (6.2.7), indicates that

                                  INJ(t   + L;)    ~   INJ(I)       + I'0(t)    - D(t, t   + LjJ              (8.3.2)

                                                   ~       ITPj(t) - D(t, t      + LjJ
                                                   ~       sj - Bj_l(t) -       D(t, t + LjJ

      LetLo   ~   0 and
                                                            Lj = Lt-:s;,jL;
      This is the backward echelon leadtime for stage j (not the forward echelon leadtime used
      in Chapter 5). Rewrite (8.3.2) at shifted times:

                          INJ(t   + L) =    sj - Bj_l(t          + Lj _ l ) -    D(t   + Li - 1• t + LjJ
      Using B;(t   + L)    ~ [-INJ(t       + L)t, we obtain the recnrsion
                              BQ(t) = 0

                      Bj(t   + L)    ~ [Bj_l(t         + Lj -    l)     + D(t + Lj -   h   t   + LJ   - sjt   (8.3.3)

      The interval (t + Li - h t + LJ has length Lj, and the intervals are disjoint. Therefore,
      D(t + Lj - l , t + L,] in (8.3.3) has the Poisson distribution with mean ALj, and these ran­
      dom variables are independent. This distribution does not depend on t, so the Bj(t + L)
      are also stationary.
           To describe the equilibrium behavior of the system, therefore, we can simply omit
      the time indicators in (8.3.3). Let
          Dj =	 leadtime demand for stage j, a generic random variable having the Poisson
                  distribution with mean XL;.. these Dj are independent
      Then,
                                             Bo~ 0

                                             B.i      =	    [BJ-l   + Dj    -   sJJ+                          (8.3.4)

      Once we have the      B;, we can determine the If through
                                             r=
                                             J

                                                  =    sJ	 -    B.J-l - Dj      + B;
      We can now compnte E[Bj] and the E[I~J, the performance measures ofprimary interest.
           Note that the calculation is not that easy. We start with D l , which has a Poisson dis­
      tribution. To get the distribution of B{, we shift and then truncate that of D10 Next, we
      fonn the sum B{ + D 2 by numerical convolution, then shift and truncate it to get B 2 The                >




      subsequent steps are similar.
           Here is a useful, relatively simple approximation: It requires only E[D) and V[DjJ, and
      is called accordingly a two-moment approximation. Start by setring E[BoJ ~ V[BoJ = o.

                        Using these quantities, approximate BJ-l + Dj with a negative-binomial distribution, and
                        then compute E[B}] and V[B}] through (8.3.4) and the methods of Section 7.5.1.1. Con­

>n leadtime used             We also need E[I1j]. On average, we send A units into stage j's supply system per

                             To evaluate a policy in economic tenns, we specify cost factors:

                             b = backorder cost rate at stage J
                        (There may also be a variable order cost c, but the average order cost is then just cA, a

                              Let us review: The main result so far is (8.3.4). This recursion concisely expresses
                        the linkages between stages. Each stage j operates much like an isolated single-stage sys­
g the Poisson           tem. The random variable Bj-l + D j plays the role of the leadtime demand; the local
                        base-stock level s; reduces stage-j backorders while increasing inventory in the usual
                        way. What links the stage to its predecessors is the term B;-I' which augments its "own"

                              Reflect for a moment on the managerial issues here: Customers see only the final­

                        Bj. (Problem 8.2 asks you to formalize this notion, specifically, to show that each E[B}] is

           An echelon base-stockpolicy is a centralized control scheme. We monitor the ech­
      elon inventory-orderpositions IOPj(I). (These quantities, it turns out, summarize all the
      relevant infonnation about the system.) We detennine orders and interstage shipments
      so as to keep each lOP/I) constant. In other words, each stage} applies a base-stock pol­
      icy. The policy variables are
               Sj ~   echelon base-stock level for stage}
      Let s =      (s)7._,.
               We can reinterpret a local base-stock policy in echelon tenns: Given s', set Sj = li2:js;,
      Now, the initial conditions !j(O) = sjandITj(O) = 0 imply IOPj(O) = s1' so the echelon base­
      stock policy dictates that every stage order a unit precisely when a deroand occurs. Thus,
      this policy is entirely eqnivalent to the original, local one.
            Conversely, every echelon base-stock policy is equivalent to a local one. Given s, if
      the Sj are nonincreasing, set sJ = s} - S)+1 (where SJ+l = 0). In general, set s)-=- = miniS)
      {s..}, and s; = sj - s;+1 (where S;+1 = 0). The policy s, it turns out, is equivalent to
      s- = {sj        rf=l'
                        whose components are nonincreasing.
            To see this, consider a two-stage system (J = 2), and assume s, < S2' Suppose the sys­
      tem starts with no inventory at stage I and inventory s, at stage 2. Stage 2 immediately or­
      ders S2 - s" but stage I has no inventory, so it backlogs those orders. In fact, stage 1's ech­
      elon inventory position is already at its base-stock level SI' so it orders only in response to
      subsequent demands. Ihus, the initial backlog at stage 1 stays there forever, that is, it re­
      mains at leasts2 - 51- Stage 1 never holds inventory, and the inventory at stage 2 never ex­
      ceeds s,. In sum, the physical flow of units is precisely the same as in the policy s-, where
      52 = 5} = S 10 and therefore as in the local policy with 5{ == 0 and s~ = 51'
            This same logic extends to arbitrary J. In general, Sj+l ~ 5j implies 5;+1 = sj. so
      5J   =   O. That is, whenever Sj+l exceeds 5j , stage} holds no inventory at all. By the way, S can
      even have some components Sj = 00 for j > 1. Provided s 1 is finite, all of the s; and 5J are
      too. Of course, if Sj+l = 00, then certainly Sj+l ;;::: 5j' so stagejnever holds inventory.
           In conclusion, every local base-stock policy is equivalent to some echelon hase­
      stock policy, and vice versa. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the true optimal policy, based
                      Chapter 8   Sevem! Items with Stochastic Demands                                           307

                      on fully centralized information, is an echelon base-stock policy. Thus, in this setting,
                      there is no essential difference between centralized and local control; centralized control
                      can be implemented locally.
                           To evaluate an echelon base-stock policy, we can convert it to the equivalent local
                      one and apply the method above. Still, it is interesting and useful to develop a scheme
                      that works directly at the echelon level: As in (8.3.2), conservation of flow inJplies that

                                            C/x) ~ hjx       + Cj+l(x)
                                            C;(y) = E[C;(y - D)]
                                                sJ ~ argrnin {Cj(y))

                                            Ck)    ~ Cj(min {sJ, xl)                               (8.3.9)

      At termination, set s* = (sj) and C* = C1(s!). We prove below that these quantities de­
      scribe the optimal policy and the optimal cost.
           Evidently, this recursion is nearly identical to the policy-evaluation algorithm above,
      but there the Sj are predetermined constants, while here the sj emerge within the calcu­
      lation. (If the minimum over C/y) is not unique, select the smallest minimizing value.
      Also,   c.;
                may be a nonincreasing function; this happens when hj = O. If so, set sj = 00,
      As discussed above, an infinite S.i does have a sensible meaning. In that case {;.j = Cj-)
      The construction of C j from CJ is illustrated in Figure 8.3.1.
           In general. the optima]~policy vector s* need not be nonincreasing. As in Sec­
      tion 8.3.2, however, it is equivalent to a nonincreasing vector s-*, where sJ--:* =
      min'''j {sn. This policy, and hence the corresponding local policy s", can be deter­
      mined only when the entire algorithm is completed. Only then can we see which stages
      hold stock and which do not.
           Now, let us prove that the algorithm does find the best policy:

                                      '" Cj(min {sJ, y)) ~ <::;(y)

      (The last inequality is also evident from Figure 8.3.1: If we use some other value of
      Sj   besides   sj to construct Cj , we end up with a function that is greater than Cj itself.)
      This completes the induction.

      8.3.4 Other Demand and Supply Processes
      The same methods can be used to evaluate and optimize. exactly or approximately, un­
      der a variety of other model assumptions.

      8.3.4.1 Compound-Poisson Demand

      Suppose that demand is a compound-Poisson process. As in Section 6.6, each increment

      of demand can be filled separately. All the arguments and results above remain valid.

      Here, each Dj has a eompound-Poisson distribution, but that is the only difference.


      8.3.4.2 Exogenous, Sequential Supply Systems

      Suppose that each stage has an exogenous, sequential supply system, as in Section 7.4.

      Let Lj(t) denote the virtualleadtime for stage j; a shipment to j begun at time t arrives at

      t + Li(t). Assume these systems are independent of one another, as well as of the de­

      mand process, so the Lj(t) are independent over}. Let Li be the equilibrium leadtime

      (random variable) for stage}.

           The analogue of (8.3.2) is now
                              INJ(t   + Li(t»    = .~ - Bi-I(t) - D(t, t      + Li(t)]
      Set Lo(t) = 0, and, for j > O. L)t) ~ Lj_l(t) + Li(t + Lj_l(t». Thus, L)t) is the total
      time required, starting at t, to pass through the first j supply systems. Rewrite the iden­
      tity above at shifted times:

                  INJ(t   + L;(t»   = si'- Bi-I(t    + Lj-I(t»      - D(t   + Lj_l(t), t + Lj(t)]
      Thus, the baekorders satisfY the following recursion, analogous to (8.3.3):
                          BOU) = 0
                Bi(t+ Lj(t» = [Bi-I(t + Lj_l(t» + D(t + Lj_l(t), t + L;(t)] - sit
      The intervals (t + L;_l(t), t + L)t)] are disjoint, and their lengths L;(t + Lj _ L(t» are in­
      dependent.
          In equilihrium this recursion takes on precisely the same form as (8.3.4); that is,

                                             o
                                            B = 0

                                            BJ = [BJ-I   + Dj   -    sJJ+
      The Dj have new meanings, however. Here, Dj has the distribution of D(LiJ, the demand
      over a random interval of time Li, like D in Section 7.4. For Poisson demand,
                                                                                 2
                             E[Dj ] = hE[Lj]          V[Dj ] = hE[L;]       +   X V[Lj]
      as in (7.5.7). Moreover, the D j are independent. Similarly, (8.3.7) evaluates an echelon
      base-stock policy directly, and therefore algorithm (8.3.9) determines the best such pol­
      icy. In sum, policy evaluation and optimization can be carried out just as in the fixed­
      leadtime case, using the new Dj in place of the old ones.
           When each Li has a continuous phase-type (CPH) distribution, the recursion (8.3.4)
      can be performed exactly by using matrix-vector operations. See Problem 8.4.

                    8.3.4.3 Limited-Capacity Supply Systems
                    Return to the Poisson-demand case. Suppose each supply system consists of a single

                    Section 7.3.2.1. Let fLj be the processing rate for stage j's processor, and Pj = A/fLj" The
                    overall system now looks much like a processing network (Section 7.3.6.1), but now we
                    can position inventory at each node, Le.. between pairs of successive processors, not just

                    mand is passed back through stages) < .1, creating a backorder at each one, all the way
                    to the supplier, which releases a unit into stage l's supply system. When the unit exits
                    the stage-I processor, stage I passes it along inunediately to the stage-2 supply system,
                    in order to fill the corresponding backorder. Likewise, each time a unit completes pro­

                    independent, and each 11] has a geometric distribution with parameter Pi.
                          For general s' 2:: 0 we can use this same distribution to approximate the I~. That is,

                    assume the I~ are independent and geometrically distributed, and then apply (8.3.10).
                    This approximation is quite accurate.
                         Notice the formal similarity of(8.3.10) and (8.3.4). Here, I~ appears in place ofD j ,
                    but otherwise the recursions are the same. Similarly! one can derive an echelon-level re­

                    Moreover, according to the approximation, the IT; are independent, just like the Dj . So,
                    using Dj to stand for the approximate I~, we can apply as is the methods of policy eval­
), the demand       uation and optimization developed above. In particular, algorithm (8.3.9) finds the (ap­

                         We remark that a base-stock policy need not be optimal here, in contrast to the
                    constant-leadtime model. A base-stock policy often works well, but the true optimal

      variables. The recursion (8.3.10) remains valid. As mentioned in Section 7.2.7, when
      s = s' = 0, the I1j are independent, and IIj has the Poisson distribution with mean
      E[llj] ~ AE[LjJ. We use this same distribution as an approximation in the general case.
           According to this approximation, then, the perfonnance of any policy is the same as
      in a constant-leadtime system; only the E[Lj] matter. As in Chapter 7, this is very dif­
      ferent from the behavior of a sequential supply system, where the leadtime variances
      contribute significantly to performance.

      8.3.4.5 Imperfect Quality
      This approach can be used to analyze a system with imperfect quality: Stage i's supply
      system occasionally produces a defective unit, which is discovered immediately and
      mustthen return to the supply system ofsome earlier stagej <; i. (Systems like this with­
      out internal inventories were discussed in Section 7.2.7 and Section 7.3.6.) Here, we
      must revise the base-stock policy slightly: A defect at stage i generates an implicit de­
      mand at all stages fromj to i-I, to account for the fact that a previously filled demand
      has now become, as it were, unfilled.
            The approach, then, is to compute the ITj as in an ordinary feedback network with­
      out internal inventories and to use the result as an approximation. In other words, com­
      pute the effective demand rates Ai as in (7.2.4), and then proceed as above. This approx­
      imation seems to be reliably accUrate.
            The overall impact of poor quality is the same as in a network without internal in­
      ventories, depending on the nature of the supply systems: For uncapacitated parallel sup­
      ply systems, poor quality increases the effective leadtimes. For limited-capacity sequen­
      tial systems, defects reduce the effective processing rates.


      8.3.5 Illustrations
      This subsection presents some numerical examples, to provide insight into the behavior
      of the optimal policy.

      8.3.5.1 Model Specificatiou

      We assume Poisson demand and constant leadtimes. Without loss of generality, we fix

      the time scale so that the totalleadtime is L ~ I, and the monetary unit so that the last

      stage's holding cost is h; = 1. The stages are spaced symmetrically, so each stagej's lead­

              L;
      time is = 1/J. We consider four numbers of stages, J = 1,4, 16, 64; two demand rates,

      A ~ 16,64; and two penalty costs, b ~ 9,39 (corresponding to fill rates of90%, 97.5%).

           We consider several forms of holding costs hJ, depicted in Figure 8.3.2. The sim­
      plest form has constant holding costs, where all hJ = 1. Here, there is no cost added from
      source to customer. This is a rather unrealistic scenario, but it is a useful starting point
      to help understand other forms. The linear holding-cost form has h; = j1J, or hj = 1/J.
      Here, cost is incurred at a constant rate as the product moves from source to customer.
      This is quite realistic. Affine holding costs, where hi ~ a + (I - a)jlJ for some a E (0,
      t), are even more realistic. Here, the material at the source has some positive cost, and
      the system then adds cost at a constant rate. This fonn is a combination of the constant
      and linear forms. Here, 0' = 0.75.

                         The last two fonns represent deviations from linearity. The kink fonn is piecewise lin­
                    ear with two pieces. The system incurs cost at a constant rate for a while, but at some point
                    shifts to a different rate, which remains constant from then on. Here, the kink occurs halfWay
                    through the process, at stage J12. So, for some {H (-I, I), hj ~ (l - a)IJ,) ~ J12, and hj

      ratios h)(b + h;),j > 1.) However, the curves break down sharply atj ~ I (because hI
      is large). Therefore, the equivalent policy s- is flat for small j, and so the policy holds
      no inventory at early stages. This solution is intermediate between those for constant and
      linear costs. As ex. increases and the costs move upward, stocks shift toward the customer.
      The total system stock decreases slightly. But, perhaps surprisingly, stocks near the cus­
      tomer actually increase.
            Figure 8.3.3c displays s* for kink holding costs. Downstream from the kink [before
      algorithm (8.3.9) encounters it], the curves exhibit the same pattern as in the linear case.
      Upstream from the kink, the policy again follows the linear pattern, ahilost as if the kink
      were the last stage. The net result is substantial stock at and just before the kink, where
      holding costs are low relative to later stages.
           Finally, Figure 8.3.3d displays s* for jump holding costs. From the jump on, the pol­
      icy behaves much as in the affine case-smooth, concave decrease beyond the jump, but
      a sharp break downwards at the jump. Upstream from the jump, the policy again follows
      the pattern of the linear case. Thus, there is substantial stock just before the jump and
      none just after it.

      8.3.5.3 Sensitivity Analysis
      Figure 8.3.4 compares the s* for different J's, each with linear holding costs, A ~ 64,
      and b = 39. The curves follow the same patterns as before, as closely as the restricted
      numbers of stages allow. Indeed, the actual echelon stock at a stocking point is nearly
      identical to the J = 64 case. Closer inspection shows that the total system stock is
      slightly higher for larger J Likewise, the optimal cost decreases in J, but quite slowly, as
      shown in Figure 8.3.5a.
            Similar results hold for affine holding costs. Indeed, the optimal cost is even less
      sensitive to J For kink holding costs (Figure 8.3.5b), the optimal cost is significantly
      lower at J ~ 4 than at J ~ 1, because of the availability of the low-cost stocking point at
      the kink. Larger J's yield relatively minor improvements. The jump form displays a sim­
      ilar pattern. Thus, for these two forms, it is important to position stock at the kink (or
      jump). Otherwise, the cost is quite insensitive to J
           These results suggest that the system cost is relatively insensitive to stock position­
      ing, provided the overall stock level is about right, and obvious low-cost stocking points
      are exploited.
           In Figure 8.3.5a and b the optimal cost for A ~ 64 is about twice that for A = 16 in
      every case. This is consistent with the notion that the optimal cost is nearly proportional
      to ~, as in a single-stage system. We have also plotted, but omit here, the cumulative
      safety stocks li$j sJ * - Aj/J The curves for A = 64 are about twice those for A = 16.
      So, the safety stocks too are nearly proportional to y'A.


      8.3.6 The Two-Stage System
      Let us focus on a system with J = 2. For the last stage j = 2,
                       Cz(x) ~ h 2 x   + (b + h~)[x]-   = h 2 [xt   + (b + hj)[x]­

       original model. If so, we have at least a lower bound on the amount of stock stage I
       should keep.
             Some simple sensitivity analysis reveals how the distinction works: First, fix all pa­
       rameters, including h 2, but let h j vary between 0 and h2(so h2 = h z - hj). As h j changes,
       so does s!. and in the same direction, but s~ remains fixed. Indeed, as hI ---7 h;, s1 ---7 00,
       so s ~ :5 s1 for sufficiently large hI' Conversely, as hI --70, h z --7 h 2, and since D is (sto­
                                        r
       chastically) larger than D 2 , s > s! for sufficiently small hj.
            Thus, stage 1 holds inventory when (but only when) it is significantly cheaper to
       hold it there than at stage 2. The required difference, of course, depends on the other
       parameters.
            Next, focus on the constant-Ieadtime case. Fix all parameters except        L;.  Only s 7 is
                                                                                  t
       affected by changes in Li, not s!. When L; is small, D is near D z, so S :5 s1. Conversely,
                                    r
       for sufficiently large Li, s > s!. (This is true for any value of L 2, but of course the dis­
                                                                                  L;
       tinction depends on L;. One can show that, as L 2 grows, the value of required to make
---     r
       s 2 s1 grows also.)
            That is, stage 1 holds inventory when (but only wheni its leadtime is substantial rel­
       ative to stage 2 s. Otherwise, if its leadtime is negligible, inventory there serves no use­
       ful function. (A similar conclusion describes stochastic-leadtime models.)

---
            Finally, applying the normal approximation to        Cr,we see that the optimal cost is
       bounded above by a linear function of (T, where (T2 = V[D]. Thus, the system parame­
  64   ters affect performance much as in a single-stage system.


       8.3.7 Economies ofScale
       Now, consider a system with scale economies in supply. There is a fixed cost kj for ship­
       ments to stage J. We restrict attention to Poisson demand with constant or exogenous­
       sequentialleadtimes.


        8.3.7.1 Fixed Costs for External Supplies
        First, suppose only k j > 0, but the other kj ~ O. That is, internal shipments generate no
        frictions, but external shipments from the outside supplier do. This special case is fairly
        simple:
              An optimal policy has the form we might expect. Stages j > I follow a base-stock
        policy, as above, while stage I follows an (r, q) policy with parameters (ri, qj), where
        ri + qj ;" O. Again, this is entirely equivalent to an echelon-based policy. That is, stages
       j > I follow an echelon base-stock policy; stage I monitors its echelon inventory-order
        position and applies an (r, q) policy to that quantity. (The echelon base-stock levels Sj are
        defined in terms of the sJ as above forj > I. Stage I uses the same q1· Letting St = ri +
        ql and SI = si + Sb the echelon reorder point is rL = Sj - qb so that Sl = rl + qt.)
             To evaluate a policy of this type, we need only evaluate certain base-stock policies
        and then average the results, as in a single-stage system. These base-stock policies all
        have the same Sj. j > I, but different Sj. Let ITP; (s) and IN,(s) denote the echelon-level
  64
        random variables under a base-stock policy, as evaluated through (8.3.7), now viewed as
        functions of s = Sj. Also, abbreviate (r" qj) ~ (r, q).
320   Foundations ofInventory Management


           Clearly, stage I's (echelon) inventory-order position lOP I behaves just like that of
      a single-stage system, so ITP I = IOP I is distributed uniformly over the integers I' + I
      through I' + q. Also, it is not hard to show that recursion (8.3.7) again describes the ITPj
      andI~. From this it follows (Problem 8.8) that each ITPj is a mixture ofthe ITPj(s), with
      s = I' + I, ... , I' + q. using the equal mixing weights l/q, and I~ IS a similar mixture
      of the I~(s). Consequently, E[I~] is just the simple average of E[I~(s)] over these s's,
      and E[B] is the average of the E[B(s)].
           To compute tbe average cost of the policy, we can use these quantities directly. Al­
      ternatively, compute the functions Cj(yls) above. The actual average cost is then
                                                      k A   + 2;,:,:q     C ( Is)
                                   C(r, q, s) =        I        y-. + I    I   Y              (8.3.11)
                                                                   q

            These facts allow us to determine the best policy through a slight modification of
      algorithm (8.3.9). Compute the functions C;,j ~ I, and the s;,j > I. These sJ are in fact
      optimaL Moreover, the average cost of a policy using these base-stock levels and any
      (I; q) at stage 1 is just

                                                 ~c   klA   + 2;"+q   C'

                                                                  q
      This looks just like (6.5.16), the cost ofa single-stage model. Because C I is convex, Al­
      gorithm Optimize_rq of Section 6.5.4 minimizes Cl(l; q) over (r, q). The minimal solu­
      tion (1'*, q*) and the sj for j > I together constitute an optimal policy.
           For a two-stage system we can obtain simple, intuitive characterizations of per­
      formance in the following way: Replace CI(y) m (8.3.12) by C~(y) from Section 8.3.6.
      Then apply Theorem 6.5.1, specifically, the bounds on the optimal single-stage cost
      (6.5.7) or (6.5.9). We then see, for instance, that <T drives performance as in the no-fixed­
      cost model; also, the optimal cost is bounded above by terms proportional to the square
      root of k I' (Problem 8.10 asks you to work out the details.)

      8.3.7.2 The General Case
      Let us turn next to the general case, where all the kjrnay be positive. Things now become
      more difficult. We do not even know what an optimal policy looks like. We describe a
      plausible type of policy. Here there are differences between local and centralized con­
      trol. We outline first a local control scheme and then a centralized one. It turns out that
      the centralized policies include the local ones, but not vice versa. We present evaluation
      and (partial) optimization procedures for the more general centralized scheme.
            Suppose each stage} uses a local (r, q) policy with parameters (1;, q), where rj + qj
      ~ O. Each stage j monitors its own local inventory-order position, and orders batches of
      size qj from its predecessor; these orders become the predecessor's demands. Assume that
      the policy is nested, meaning that, for j < J, ~; and qj are integer multiples of qj+ t. This is
      a reasonable restriction: Stage j experiences demands of size qj+ l' so it makes sense to or­
      der and to maintain stocks in similar units. Under this condition, if each IJ (0) = ~; + q} and
      ITj(O) = 0, then IN;(t) and lOP;(t) remain integer multiples of qJ+I for all t. And, the pol­
      icy is nested in the sense that, whenever stage j orders, so does j + 1.

s just like that of          Now, consider an echelon (r, q) policy. This works just likc a local (r, q) policy, except
te integers r + 1     that each stage monitors its echelon inventory-order position and bases its orders on that
escribes the ITPj     quantity. The policy variables are (rj • q). Assume that the policy is quasi-nested; that is, qj
 the ITPj(s), with    is an integer multiple of qj+ l' (This makes sense, for the reasons mentioned above. We can
I similar mixture     and do set each IJ(O) to an integer multiple of qj+ L, so INJ(t) remains an integer multiple
rJ] over these s's,   of qj+ 1 for all t.) As for the rJ' however, we require only that rj + qj ~ o.
                             Given a local (r. q) policy, there is an equivalent echelon (r. q) policy: Use the same
ities directly. AI­   CJ.j, and set sJ = 1/ + 9;, ~~; = li~jsi: and I; = s} - 9; (so that S.i = rj + q). Clearly, the
1St is then           state variables have precisely the same values at all times under these two policies. Con­
                      versely, starting with an echelon-based policy, there is an equivalent nested local policy,
           (8.3.11)   if each rj - rj + 1 is an integer multiple of qj+ l' (The argument parallels the earlier one
                      for base-stock policies.) Otherwise, thete is no equivalent local policy. Although it may
modification of       not be obvious, the full freedom to choose the rJ in echelon (r. q) policies, beyond the re­
ese s_f are in fact   stricted values oflocal policies, can indeed be valuable.
(: levels and allY           Intuitively, the relation between local and echelon policies can be seen by compar­
                      ing the behavior of lOP; and IOPi . Both increase by qj whenever stage j orders. But,
                      lOP; decreases only when stage j + I orders, while lOP} decreases with each actual cus­
                      tomer demand. That is, under the echelon policy stage j learns about customer demands
           (8.3.12)
                      instantaneously, whereas under the local policy there is a delay in transmitting this in­
                      fonmation until enough demands accumulate to trigger an order by stage j + 1. If the
~ I is convex, Al­
                      echelon policy parameters satisfy the condition above, so that there is an equivalent lo­
e minimal solu­       cal policy, then this delay is immaterial; the extra information is not used. Otherwise,
                      there is a real difference. (We call the echelon policy "centralized," because it requires
izations of per­      more information than stage-ta-stage orders. Given that information, however, the con­
n Section 8.3.6.      trol decisions are still taken locally.)
ingle-stage cost             We now present a recursive method to evaluate an echelon (1; q) policy, analogous
in the no-fixed­      to (8.3.7). First, ITP, ~ lOP! IS distributed unifonmly over the integers r, + I through
"I to the square      r 1 + q 1· Second, it remains true that
                                                                 INj   = ITPj   - Dj

                      Finally, recall that, for a base-stock policy,ITPj + 1 = min {Sj+l' IN), which can be writ­
gs now become         ten as Sj + 1 - ITPj + 1 = [Sj+ I - I~] + . The analogue here, it turns out, is
. We describe a
                                                   Sj+l -­ ITPj+1      =   7r(sj+l-IN.,. qj+d                                     (8.3.13)

      when each batch incurs its own cost, for then the average shipment cost to stage j is just

            This technique can evaluate any echelon (r, q) policy. What about optimization? Given

            To determine the best q, a reasonable heuristic approach is to apply the methods of
      Chapter 5 to the corresponding deterministic system to obtain a good initial q. Chen and
      Zheng [I 994c] develop an alternative method, based on cost bounds (discussed below),
      which seems to work even better. Then, apply a local search, using the algorithm above
      at each step to optimize over r.
            There are ways to calculate a lower bOlrod on the true optimal cost. (Problem 8.11
      explores one idea.) By comparing this bound to the cost of a good (or the best) echelon
      (r, q) policy, we can estimate the policy's perfonnance relative to all possible alterna­
      tives. In this way researchers have found that, for some systems, an echelon (r, q) policy
      performs quite well; the policy's cost exceeds the lower bound by only a few percent. We
      still lack strong results like those of Chapter 5, however. Specifically, we do not have a
      policy-construction heuristic that is guaranteed to perform well. This remains a pressing
      priority for research.


      8.3.8 A Service-Level Constraint
      Return to the case of no scale economies and Poisson demand. The models above mea­
      sure customer service by outstanding backorders; to achieve adequate service, they pe­
      nalize E[B;] by the cost b. Suppose instead there is a specified limit I - "'_ on the frac­
      tion of demands backordered. We suggest the following simple approach, in the spirit of
      Section 6.5.5: Set b so that bl(b + hf) ~ "'_, and proceed as above.
           This approach works: Suppose we determine an optimal base-stock policy. Among
      other things, this policy chooses s; to minimize h;E[I;] + bE[BJ], given the other Sf'
      Consequently, as in Section 6.5.2, it sets the stockout probability E[A;] near I - ",_.
      (Under a continuous approximation, E[Aj] = 1 - w_ exactly; the relation is approxi­
      mate in a discrete model.) And E[A)] is the fraction of demands backordered.
           Still, there is no guarantee that, among all feasible policies, this one minimizes the
      total average holding cost. But it is quite difficult to optimize in this sense, and the ap­
      proach above is likely to perform well.

324   Foundations ofInventory Management


           As in Section 5.4.2, we can interpret this picture as a project schedule, and this view­
      point provides some insight into the meaning of effective control. Suppose we operate
      the system entirely without inventories. When a demand occurs, we must order all the
      components and assemble them from scratch. Clearly, we want to schedule these events
      as indicated in the figure. This approach fills the demand as soon as possible, but given
      that requirement, it performs all activities as late as possible. Specifically, we order item
      1 immediately, but wait a while before ordering item 2, so that the two units arrive to­
      gether to be assembled into item 4. We order item 3 even later (but before the arrival of
      1 and 2), so it arrives just when item 4 is ready.
           Can a local control scheme realize this tight schedule? Consider what happens un­
      der a local base-stock policy with base-stock levels zero. A demand propagates back­
      ward through the network, so we order all raw materials (items 1,2, and 3) immediately.
      Items 2 and 3 thus arrive too soon, before they can be used. Of course, we could modify
      this policy, either by delaying the demand signals or by instructing each item to wait be­
      fore acting on its signals. But such modifications violate the spirit of pure local controL
           The same issues arise when we do maintain inventories. Purely local information is
      inadequate to operate the system intelligently. (And the simple modifications above do
      not suffice in genera1.) We need global information.
           Nevertheless, as we shall see, an assembly system can be reduced to an equivalent
      series system. Once we construct this equivalent system, we can use the methods of Sec­
      tion 8.3 for policy evaluation and optimization. The best policy. it turns out, is much like
      an echelon base-stock policy. To manage each item, however, it utilizes more than just
      locally available information.
           As explained in Section 8.1, there are situations that require a local policy, where
      centralized control is expensive or impossible to implement. As shown in Section 8.4.5
      below, series-system methods can also be used to evaluate a local base-stock policy_
           (We do not yet know how to extend these results to stochastic supply systems. Nor
      do we know how to incorporate fixed costs, except in one very special case, discussed
      in Problem 8.13.)


      8.4.2 Echelon Analysis and Inventory Balance
      Define echelon-level state variables with the same meanings as in Section 5.4.3 and Sec­
      tion 8.3.2. Item i's echelon inventory is the systemwide stock ofi, including the local in­
      ventory of i itself, but also all downstream items along the path from i to 1, as well as
      their supply systems. The net echelon inventories and the echelon inventory-transit po­
      sitions can be defined recursively as
                                INAt) = IAt) - B(t) = I;(t) - B;(t)

                                IN,(t)   ~   Ii (t)   + ITP/t)        i    E   Pre (j)

      includes a unit each of the i E Pre (j)) Also,

      there is no reason to order more ofitem 4. Otherwise, if rrp4(1) < IN; (f), we may wish to
      raise ITP4 (1), but not beyond IN;(I).
           We can visualize the idea here by drawing a vertical slice through the network, like
      the dashed line ofFigure 8.4.2. To the right ofthe slice, downstream, is a subnetwork in­
      cluding all of item 4's supply system, but only part of item 3's. The points where the line
      crosses the leadtime arrows represent the same totalleadtime to the end item. The ech­
      elon inventories downstream from these points are precisely IN;(I) and ITP4(1), and we
      want to equate these values as nearly as possible.
           We can draw a slice anywhere in the network. Such a slice typically intersects sev­
      eral items' leadtimes. These intersection points are equidistant from the end item in
      tenus of total leadtime. Now, consider the echelon inventory downstream from each in­
      tersection point, i.e., the total inventory along the path from the point to the end item.
      Ideally, we would like all these echelon inventories to be equal.
           It is clear, then, that we cannot hope to operate the system intelligently using local
      information only. In the example above, the slice relates two items, 3 and 4, which hap­
      pen to be close neighbors, but of course that need not be true in general. We may well
      wish to balance the inventories of items that are quite far apart in the network. In other
      words, we must coordinate actions explicitly across the entire system.
           Fortunately, the requirements for effective coordination are less fonnidable than
      they seem at first glance. To see why, suppose some slice indicates balancing the inven­
      tories of seven different items. To achieve the necessary coordination, it makes sense to
                                                                      ---

                  consider the items in pairs, that is, to balance the first with the second, the second with
                  the third, and so on. This, it turns out, is sufficient; to control each item, we must pay at­
                  tention to one other item. But which one? The new item-numbering scheme above pro­
                  vides the answer: For each item} > I we must take into account the status ofitem} - 1.


                  8.4.3 The Balanced Echelon Base-Stock Policy
                  We now define a class of plausible policies. The basic logic is the same as that of an ech­
                  elon base-stock policy; there are policy variables sf' which determine the overall inven­
                  tory levels. We adjust that policy, however, to improve the balance among the invento­
                  ries. We call the result a balanced echelon base-slackpolin'. The best policy ofthis type
                  is truly optimal. (We shall not prove this fact.)
                        Recall, the original 0(t) is the stock (in item)'s units) shipped in the interval
                  [I - Lj, I). Define
                       ITi(l) = portion of IT.i(I) shipped in the interval [I - Lj, I - Lj')
                       IN;(/) = ITj(t) + I~(t)
                  (Recall that Lj' S Lj. If the two are equal, then IT} (I) ~ 0 and IN;(/) ~ I~(t).)
                        The policy works as follows: Item I uses an ordinary echelon base-stock poliey with
                  policy parameter SI' For item} > I we adjust the base-stock policy using the variable
                  IN;_I (I). Specifically, we decide the quantity to ship toward item} so as to bring ITPi(t)
                  as close as possible to min {si' IN;_I(/). That is, if ITP/I-) is already more than this
                  quantity before any shipments, we ship nothing. If ITPi(t-) is less, we ship the differ­
                  ence, provided there is sufficient inventory of items i • Pre (j) to do so. And if one of
~maywish to       those inventories is too small, we ship as much as possible, that is, we set 1TPlt) = mini

      Thus, the policy ensures that, for all t "" 0,
                                     ITPj(t)       <;    min lSi' IN;_I(t)}                      (8.4.2)
      (Only a demand can cause IN;_l(t) to fall, but this reduces ITPj(t) by the same amount.)
      For current purposes, the key part of (8.4.2) is
                                         ITP;(t)
                                            .

      This condition is known as long-run balance.

      Then, for all) > I and i. Pre (j). IN;(I) "" IN;_l(t).
      <:we postpone the proof until Section 8.4.6.) Thus, we never have to worry about the
      predecessor inventories; they are guaranteed to be sufficient. We need only compare
      ITPj(t) to mm {Sj,INj_1 (t)}.
           (Actually, from any initial conditions, if the system runs for a while, it will attain
      (8.4.2) at some finite time t. And once the system enters this state, it will never leave.
      So, the theorem applies and the policy simplifies for sufficiently large t. To simplify the
      discussion, assmne the special starting conditions above, so the theorem holds as stated.)
          Consequently, (8.4.2) in fact holds as an equality:
                                         ITP;(t) = min         {Sf'   IN;_I(t))
      Notice the similarity to (8.3.6)! Also,
                                 IN;(t    + Lj') = ITPj(t)            - D(t,   I   + Lj']
      Following the approach of Section 8.3.2, rewrite these equations using a simple time shift:
                              ITP1(1)    = SI
                         IN;(t   + L)    = ITPj(t        + Lj - 1) -    D(l    + Li -" I + Ltl
                      ITP;+I(t   + L;l   ~ min {si+" INj(t              + L;)}
      In equilibrium this becomes
                                            ITP j    ~    s,
                                             INj     = ITPj     - Dj                             (8.4.4)

                                          ITPj +1 = min {sj+"IN;}
      where Dj has the same distribution as D(L}'). and the D; are independent. This has pre­
      cisely the same form as (8.3.7)!

      8.4.4 Policy Evaluation and Optimization
      We are now ready to describe the equivalent series system: It has J stages, the same de­
      mand process and echelon cost rates h; and b as the assembly system, but leadtimes LJ~
      Thus, its leadtime demands Dj are precisely those above. By (8.4.4), therefore, its I~ are
      precisely the IN; of the original assembly system.

                         Suppose we apply the policy-evaluation algorithm of Section 8.3.2 to this series sys­
                     tem, using the same policy parameters s. The average cost, in the assembly system's
           (8.4.2)   terms, is

                     This is not the same as (8.4.1), the average cost ofthe assembly system. But LJ = Lj,
           (8.4.3)   so IN; = INJ and [IN;J- = B. Also, by a simple conservation argument, E[ITj] ~
                     E[D(Li - L;')], so
                                         E[IN;]    = E[IN;] + E[ITj] = E[IN;] + E[D(Li -   L;')]
holds for all t.
                     Consequently, the computed cost (8.4.5) exceeds the true cost (804.1) by
                                                            Lf~lhjE[D(Li - Lj')]                           (8.4.6)

                           Well, almost; there remains one loose end: What happens when two or more of the
                     L.} are equal? We can resolve ties arbitrarily in renumbering the items. But then some of
                     the Lj' are 0, and the corresponding Dj ~ O. What happens in the equivalent series sys­
                     tem (or any series system) in this case? If D; = 0, intuitively, inventories at stagesj - 1
                     andj perform the same function, but stagej's is more expensive, so there is no reason to

                           In the assembly system too, we choose sj :s; Sjt-l, but here this condition has a dif­
                     ferent meaning: lfj E Pre (j + I), we never hold inventory of itemj, but otherwise we
                     may. For instauce, consider the system of Figure 804.1, but suppose items I and 2 have
                                                     t,
                     the same actualleadtime L so L Z ~ O. This implies INrCt) = ITP I(t). The policy thus
                     dictates that ITP,(t) = min {s!,ITPI(t)) ~ ITPI(t) ~ Sl' Consequently, we always main­
                     tain the same inventories of items 1 and 2. This is just what common sense suggests.

                     8.4.5 Local Base-Stock Policy Evaluation
        (8.4.4)
                     Now suppose we are unable to implement the control scheme above, and instead use a
                     local base-stock policy. To illustrate the idea, focus on a two-stage assembly system,
This has pre-        where all itemsj < J are raw materials, that is, direct predecessors of the end item 1, with
                     no predecessors of their own. Number the items as above, so among the materials, item
                     I has the longest leadtime, and item J - I the shortest.
                          Again, we ship units to J only in kits. So, it is possible that some items have both
                     (local) inventory and backorders simultaneously. Actually, the backorders of itemsj < J
 the same de­        are equal. If any (and hence all) of these items are backlogged, however, at least one has
leadtimes L/         no inventory.

      the supplier for each raw material. Consequently, JOPj(l) =               sf' and IN;(I + Lj) = sJ
      D(I, I + Lj],j < J. It is clear, moreover, that

                             B;(I) = Bj-J(I) = [min,<J {IN;(I)W                  j<J

            Define the L} and Lj as above. Let us evaluate the material backorders at time t +
      L J- J. Notice, (I + L J- J) - Lj = I + Lj _ j • Also, suppose the s; are nonincreasing for
      j<J(whichisreasonable), and sets7_1 = SJ-h andsj= s; - s;+j, 1 5 j 5 J - 2. Then,

                                IN;(I   + L J- 1)   =   s; -. D(I + Lj_l> I + LJ-d

      Consequently,

               Bj_l(t   + L J- 1)   = max {O, ~j$'<J (D(I         + L"l> I + Ltl - s7) :j < J)
      In equilihrium this hecomes

                                BJ-l    =   max {D, "ij~j<J(Di - s7):j < J}
           This is precisely the form of the hackorders in a (J - I)-stage series system. (See
      Problem 8.2.) The    s7play the roles of the local hase-stock levels here, and the s; func­
      tion as echelon hase-stock levels. Then, as in (8.3.4), we have
                                             BJ = [BJ-I + DJ      -   sj]+                                 8.5 Distd
      Thus, we can calculate E[B}] and E[I}] with the methods of Section 8.3. Also,
                                E[I;] = E[IN;]          + E[Bj]
                                        =   s; - E[D(Lj)] + E[Bj_l]            j<J
           In sum, we can evaluate a local base-stock policy through an equivalent series sys­
      tem. (It is not clear how to find the best such policy, however, for E[In is not related to
      E[B;l as in the series system.) The same ideas extend directly to any assemhly system.
      (See Problem 8.14 for another example.)
           Evidently, it requires about the same effort to evaluate local and centralized policies,
      and we know how to optimize the latter. Remember too that, implementation issues
      aside, the hest balanced echelon base-stock policy performs hetter than any local policy.
      Given a choice, therefore, a balanced policy is definitely better.

                                    Consider a two-level distribution system. For the sake of concreteness, suppose there is
                                    a single product and several geographic locations. For convenience we modify- the in­

rotation issues                     lows its own local base-stock policy. Each retailer orders stock from the warehouse. All
II}' local policy.                  these orders together constitute the warehouse's demand process. The warehouse fills
                                    these demands (dispatches shipments to the retailers) sequentially, that is, on a first­
                                    come-fIrst-served basis. Ibe warehouse in turn places its own replenishment orders with
                                    the supplier.
                                          Thus, information and control are decentralized or localized: Each retailer sees only
alive for small                     its own demands, and the warehouse sees only the incoming order streams. Each loca­
(f) ~ I~(f) ~                       tion, including the warehouse, monitors only its own inventory-order position, and
                                    makes decisions on that basis. (The next section explores a centralized scheme.)
                                          The demands at the retailers are independent Poisson processes Dj,j = 1, ...• J.
                                    Assuming each location begins fully stocked (at its base-stock level), these demands
                                    propagate backward to the warehouse. The warehouse's demand process Do, therefore,

         The policy variables are the base-stock levels sJ 2 O.
               This is a simplified version of a model-based planning system called METRIC, de­
         veloped in the 1960s to help manage inventories of aircraft engines and other critical,
         expenSive components for the United States Air Force. (There, a retailer represents an
         airbase, and the warehouse a central support facility.) Since then, METRIC has been re­
         fined and extended in several ways. It and its cousins have been adopted by other armed
         forces in the United States and other countries and also by several airlines. (In those ap­
         plications a demand arises from the failure of an operating unit, and the supply systems
         represent repair activities as well as transponation. The real demand and supply
         processes are more complex than the model's; each airbase has a finite number of de­
         mand sources, the maximal number of operational units, as in Section 7.3.3.3, and each
         supply system has limited capacity. The model approximates reality, suppressing these
         complications.)
               As explained in Chapter 5, the locations in the model can be relabeled as generic
         items, which can equally well represent different products or product-location pairs. In
         a multiproduct system the retailers correspond to distinct finished goods. The warehouse
         represents a unifOlID intermediate product, which can be transformed into any of the fin­
         ished goods.
               Real distribution systems typically move many products through a network ofloca­
         tions. The model here cannot represent that degree of complexity; our warehouse is lim­
         ited to a single item. Sometimes, however, there are no strong links between the prod­
         ucts like joint replenishment costs. Then, the products themselves are independent, and
         we can use a s~p(jrate copy of the model for each one. METRIC-like models are fre­
         quently used in this way.
               Incjdentnlly, this approach works much better than a common alternative heuristic,
         which divides the world by location instead of by product. There, each location manages
         its inventories separately, ignoring the links to other locations. The heuristic tries to com­
         pensate for the missing links by imposing a service-level constraint on each location,
         usually based on an aggregate criterion like the average fill rate over all products. This
         sounds reasonable, but it is not enough; the aggregate constraints cannot adequately cap­
         ture the location links.


         8.5,2 Policy Evaluation
         To evaluate a given policy, we follow a "top-down" approach, analogous to (8.3.2) to
         (8.3.4). We first analyze the warehouse and then the retailers.
              The warehouse operates just hke the first stage in a series system., so

                    Next, consider retailer j. The logic of Section 8.3.1 leads to the following analogue of
                    (8.3.4):

                                                          B;    =   [Bh j   + Pi -   sJ]+                         (8.5.2)

                    where E Oj indicates the warehouse backorders generated by orders from the individual
                    retailer j. Now, the warehouse is a system with multiple input sources, as in Sec­

      Let s' denote the vector of retailer policy variables (S;)f~ I. The total average cost is then
                                    C(so, s') ~ Corso)       + lf~1 C;(so, sf)
           Unfortunately, there is no simple, elegant procedure to optimize this function. (The
      recursive algorithm for series systems cannot be extended to distribution systems.) The
      most popular approach is a projection method: The main loop of the algorithm searches
      over possible values of So to find the best. For each So, an inner loop detennines the best
      values of the other s}.
           The advantage of this approach is that, with So temporarily fixed, the objective func­
      tion C(5(), s') separates by j, so the inner loop can optimize over each sJ separately. More­
      over, as a function of sJ only, each of the Cj(soJ sf) has the same fonn as the single-location
      cost function of Chapter 6 (in particular, it is convex), so it is easy to minllnize. Further­
      more, let s;(so) denote the optimal value ofs; for fixed sQ. It is intuitively clear (and not hard
      to show) that each s}(so) is nonincreasing in so; as we add more stock at the warehouse, we
      need less at the retailers. So, if the search process increases sO sequentially, we need only
      consider ever smaller values of the s}.
           We are still left with the problem of finding the optimal          So,
                                                                              that is, of choosing So to
      minimize C(so, s'(so)). Unfortunately, this is not a convex function of So' Exhaustive
      search is the only sure method. (On the other hand, people who work with such models
      have found that a local search nearly always finds the global optimum.)
           The normal approximation can be applied to this system. Let IJ.-j and a} denote the
      mean and variance of Dj . j 2:: O. The normal approximation at the warehouse yields
                                                   E[B o] = <lJI(zo)"o
                                        E[Bo(B o - I)] = 2<lJ2(ZO)"~
                                                       E[lo] = <lJI( -zo)"o
      where Zo   = (so   - i-Lo)/CTo. Moreover,
                              E[B oj] = ejE[Bb]
                             V[B oj] = e)1 - e;)E[Bb]          + e/V[Bb]         j>O
      Now, approximate each BOj + Dj by a normal distribution with the same mean and variance,

                                             j!,; = E[B oj ]     +   ~j

      The normal approximation for retailer j yields

                                             E[I)] = <lJI( -z)!!j

                          Let us  examine the joint impact of So and J on the total cost (8.5.4).     First, fix
                    So   = O. In this case the retailers operate independently, as in the parallel system of
                    Section 8.2, each with total effective leadtime L o + L;. Indeed, V[B o] = E[B o] =
                    AoL o, so ([, ~ [JAo(Lo + L;.)] 1/2 Apart from the constant hoAoL;., (8.5.4) reduces to
                    the same form as (8.2.3); for fixed total demand 1.. 0 , the total cost is proportional to
                    Vi.   Now, raise So to any positive value. This increases E[Iol and reduces V[Bbl, of
                    course, but those effects are independent of 1. Also, raising So reduces one of the fac­
n and variance,
                    tors of J in!L, (E[BoD, leaving the other (AoL;) constant. In sum, for any so, the over­
                    all cost (8.5.4) depends roughly on the square root of the number of retailers, but the
                    strength of this dependence declines as So increases.
                          Thus, warehouse stock performs two distinct functions: It may just be cheaper than
                    retailer inventory, as in a series system. In addition, it serves to pool some ofthe retail­
                    ers'demand uncertainties; it can be used to fill an order from any retailer, and this flex­
                    ibility softens the impact ofthe warehouse's own leadtime, Lb. Warehouse stock thus al­
                    lows us to enjoy some of the advantages of consolidation, while still maintaining
                    multiple retail locations.

      around Sao Paulo. It is considering leasing a warehouse in the outskirts of the city and supplying its
      outlets from there.
           Tbere are J = 16 locations, all identical. Each faces Poisson demand at a rate of A = 0.625
      cases per day. The totalleadtime to each location is L = 4.4 days. The cost rates are b = R$10 and
      h = R$O.62 per case-day. (The currency in Brazil is the real, abbreviated R$.) There are no scale
      economies.
           The current setup treats the locations as independent items (as in Section 8.2). The optimal
      base-stock level for each location is s* = 5. with total cost over all locations (omitting the pipeline
      holding cost) ofR$38 per day.
            If the company leases the warehouse, the Teadtimes will be La = 2.8 and L; = 1.6. The back­
      order cost will remain b = 10, and the holding costs will be hb = h~ = 0.62. (Notice, the holding
      cost at the warehouse is the same as at the loeations, and the totalleadtime remains 4.4.) The best
      local base-stock policy is s~ = 28, and each s) = 3, with total eost C = R$26.4. Evidently, een­
      tralized inventory offers substantial savings in this case.



      8.5.4 Extensions
      Most of the extensions of the basic series-system model work here as well.


      8.5.4.1 Compound-Poisson Demand

      It is not a simple matter, however, to evaluate a distribution system with compound-Poisson

      demands. The warehouse itself is no problem: Suppose Y; indicates the demand-size ran­

      dom variable for retailer j. The total demand at the warehouse, then, is also a compound­

      Poisson process; the demand-epoch rate is AD, and the demand size Yo is a mixture ofthe y;,

      using the mIxing weights aj" Knowing this, we can determine the distribution of Do> and then

      use (8.5.1) for Bh.

            The difficulty appears when we try to analyze the retailers. The binomial-disaggregation
      method breaks down, and the waiting time BWh becomes quite complex. Exact analysis is
      therefore much harder here than in the pure Poisson-demand case.
            We can extend the two-moment approximation, by invoking another rather crude
      approximation step: Suppose all retailers have the same demand-size distribution, so
      Yo = .f;. = Y Now, assume that the backorders B oalways comprise an integral mimber
      of demand batches, say Nh. (This is true for So ~ 0, but not otherwise.) Under this ap­
      proximation, Bohas a compound distribution, built from those of No and Y Given E[Bo]

      Next, the number Nh j ofthese batches originating at retailer j can be detennined through
      binomial disaggregation, as in (8.5.3):

                                        E[NhjJ= ajE[NQl

                       cruder approximation. To avoid these difficulties, most of the discussion below assumes
                       pure Poisson demands.

eU.
                       Suppose each supply system is exogenous and sequential. The warehouse's system is in­

                       dependent of the retailers'. (The retailers' supply systems. however, need not be inde­ 

                       pendent of one another. For instance, every retailer's supply system may include loading

rIpOund-Poisson        activities at the warehouse.)

                       the warehouse waiting times for successive demands as independent; thus, each retailer
                       faces independent total order leadtimes. Under any of these three interpretations, Bbj +

           This simplified approach extends directly to compound-Poisson demand. That is,
      compute E[Bol in the usual way. Compute E[BWoJ = E[Bo]/(AoE[YoD, by the arguments
      of Section 6.2.4. Then, treating BWo as the constant E[BWol, determine the (compound­
      Poisson) distribution of each BOj + ITj , and proceed to compute the E[Bl].
           This is sometimes called the METRIC approximation, for it was introduced in the             8.6 Distril
      original version of that model. It is fairly accurate, though less so than the two-moment
      approximation.


      8.5.4.5 Geueral Distribution Networks
      These methods can be extended directly to any distribution system (a network of items
      indexed j = 0, ... , J, where each item j > 0 has a unique predecessor, and item 0 has
      none). Problem 8.16 asks you to work out the details.
           Also, it is easy to incorporate exogenous demands for any or all items. In the two­
      level system, for instance, suppose demands occur at the warehouse as well as the re­
      tailers. Suppose these new demands form a Poisson process with rate "'-0. independent of
      the retailers' demands. Just add a dummy retailer to the network. Assign the warehouse's
      exogenous demands to the new retailer, and set the retailer's leadtime and base-stock
      level to zero. This augmented system, clearly, is equivalent to the original one.


      8.5.5 Economies ofScale

      Now, suppose evcry location has its own fixed cost kJ for shipments. As in Section 8.3.7,

      we begin with the special case where only external orders (here, from the warehouse)
      entail scale economies, so k o > 0 and the other ki = O. Accordingly, suppose the retail­
      ers all use base-stock policies, but the warehouse uses an (r, q) policy. (These are aIllo­
      cal policies.)
           This system is quite tractable: The warehouse operates like a single-location system
      with Poisson demand, so again IGPois uniformly distributed. Fmthermore, conditional
      on IGP = So = s, B and the B; have the same distributions as under a pure base-stock
              o               o
      policy with parameters (s, s'). Consequently, the total cost can be written as a simple av­
      erage, analogous to (8.3.11):
                                          ,   koAo   + I;~;+ 1 C(s, s')
                                    C(r,q,S)=                                                (8.5.7)
                                                           q
      Again, to optimize this function, use a projection algorithm: For any fixed (r, q), com­
      pute the best sJ separately for each} by minimizing a convex function. Using this tech­
      nique as a subroutine, search for the optimal (r*, q*).
           The general case, where there are also scale economies for internal shipments, so
      any of the '9 can be positive, is far more difficult. We briefly summarize the state of the
      art: As in Section 8.3.7.2, it is plausible to use a an (r, q) policy at each location. Such a
      policy may use either local or echelon information. (The difference appears only at the
      warehouse, of course.) It is no longer the case, however, that local (r, q) policies reduce
      to echelon (r, q) policies; these are two distinct policy classes. Neither one, moreover, al­
      ways performs better than the other. There are methods to evaluate any such policy ex­
                                                                                                                                        , :'I"'I:"'' :IL!II'IIIII'' "

                               The local base-stock policy of the last section is appealing in many ways. It seems rea­
                               sonable, in particular, for the warehouse to fill demands sequentially. Duning periods
                               when the warehouse has stock on hand, this just means filling demands as they OCCUf.
etwork of items                But consider what happens when the warehouse runs out of stock (a common event if it
, and item 0 has               keeps little or no inventory): Suppose that, first, a single demand arrives from retailer 1.
                               Retailer 2 generates the next 45 demands. At that point the warehouse receives a unit
IDS. In the two­
                               from its supply system. Where should it send this unit? Under the FIFO rule, the unit
, well as the re­              must go to retailer 1, because its demand occurred first, even though retailer 2 clearly
 independent of                needs it morc.
:he warehouse's                     The weakness of the local-control scheme, then, is that it relies on history rather
and base-stock                 than the current status of the system to make crucial decisions. This section describes an
il one.                        alternative approach, which requires and exploits fully centralized information. This ap­
                               proach seems to work well, especially for high-volume goods, specifically, when the to­
                               tal demand volume is large compared to the individual retailers' demand fluctuations.
                               This is just the kind of situation where a capable information system can be justified eco­
                               nomically. (For low-volume items the local-control mechanism suffices, because the re­

      In the spirit of (8.3.8) this can be rewritten as

           Now, let us shift the way these costs are counted. Consider: There is nothing we can
      do at time t to affect retailer} before time t + Li. So, we lose nothing by shifting certain
      costs back in time, counting at time t the expected cost at retailer j at time t + Lj. Thus,
      the total cost rate becomes

                       hoINo(t)     + lf~l    E[hjINj(t   + Li) + (h j + h;)Bj(t + Lin      (8.6.1)
      (This type of transformation is widely used and widely useful. Section 9.6 justifies it in
      a simpler context, but it is valid here too.) Indeed, as in (8.3.2), we have
                                   I~(t     + Li) = ITPj(t)   - Dj(t, t   + Li]             (8.6.2)

      we can rewrite (8.6.1) in the compact form

      8.6.2 MyopicAllocation and the BalancedApproximation
      Even with the reduction to (8.6.3), the true optimal policy is virtually impossible to com­
      pute and too complex to implement. We present a simple heuristic approach that seems
      to work well.
           Consider a decision to ship stock from !he warehouse to the retailers. It is helpful to
      separate the decision into twu steps, withdrawal and allocation. First, we choose a quan­
      tity of stock to withdraw from the warehouse, the total amount to be shipped to all the
      retailers. Second, we decide how to allocate this amount among the retailers.
           Let us focus fur!her on the allocation step: Suppose we are at time t. There may be
      demands at t and/or an order arriving at the warehouse. Let INQ, IT?! ' and ITP; denote

      withdraw some specific amount. The effect is to raise ITPr(t) from ITP~ to a higher
      value, which we denote ITPr The problem, then, is to allocate ITPr among the individ­
      ual retailers' ITP/t).
           We propose the following heuristic allocation rule: Allocate so as to minimize the
      current total cost rate, as measured by (8.6.3). We call !his rule myopic allocation, for it
      takes into account only current costs (or rather, the costs we count now), ignoring future
      developments.
           Some additional notation will help express this method in clearer tenns: Set sj =
      ITPjand Sr = ITPr . Also, letsj denote !he value of ITPj(t) after allocation. In !hese terms
      myopic allocation dictates solving the following optimization problem:

                     equation in (8.6.4) is satisfied, i.e., until the entire quantity withdrawn has been allo­

                     , equal to this common value, until' hits the third smallest Ci(s). Continue in this man­
                     ner, stopping when the equation is satisfied exactly. The end result, clearly, is a feasible
                     solution satisfying (8.6.5), hence an optimal solution.

      is, given this scenario, myopic allocation is truly optimal. In this setting, myopic alloca­
      tion means solving a model like (8.6.4), but without the inequality constraints:

      Let   C~(s,)   denote the optimal objective value as a function of s,. The optimality condi­
      tions now become the simple equations

                                            C;(S) ~ ~                j = 1, ... ,J
      instead of (8.6.5). The solution to this model thus equates aU the marginal costs C;(Sj)'
      The approximation thus assumes that the retailers' inventories are perfectly balanced at
      an points in time. For this reason we call it the balanced approximation.
           Now, let us also apply the normal approximation: We have

           Consider the equal-cost case, where all hj = h, and all bj = b. Here, (8.6.7) implies
      that all the Zj must be equal, say to z,. Indeed,

                     this, set hand b to the smallest retailer cost rates. i.e.,

                     and h' = ho + h in C,(s) above. (Clearly, the result is a lower bound on C~(s,), but why
                     should it be an accurate approximation? [ntuitively, when Sr is large, so the system has
                     ample inventory, we want to push most of that stock to the retailer with the lowest hold­
                     ing cost. Likewise, when Sr is small, we concentrate inventory in retailers with large

[8.6.7) implies      native approach which sometimes works better. See Problem 8.17.)
                          Under the balanced approximation, then, the overall cost rate (8.6.3) now becomes
                                                             hoINo{t)    + C,(ITP,.(t))
                     This is just the cost rate ofa two-stage series system. Thus, we can apply all the methods
                     of Section 8.3 to this system. In patticular, we can detennine rhe optimal (echelon base­

ral, it equates      tribute stock in ways that are actually infeasible. So, the optimal cost of this series system

:rive fimction             We now propose a plausible heuristic policy for the original system: Apply the bal­
                     anced approximation. and solve the resulting series system. Use the optimalpolicy to de­
                     termine both orders from the supplier and warehouse withdrawals, and use myopic al­
                     location to divide the withdrawals among the retailers. The average cost of this feasible
                     policy, of course, is an upper bound on the optimal cost. Also, we propose to use the op­
                     timal cost ofthe series system to estimate the performance ofthe original system.
                           Intuitively, this approach should work well: Myopic allocation does all a policy can
                     do to equalize the retailers' marginal costs. They will not be equal at all times, as the bal­
                     anced approximation assumes, because demands decrement the ITP;(t) by random
                     amounts, so the marginal costs may drift away from equality. One may hope, neverthe­
                     less, that the equalizing effects of allocation will compensate for such fluctuations, or
344   Foundations ofInveillory Management


      nearly so. If so, the distortions induced by the balanced approximation will be minor.
      This is especially likely in high-volume systems, where there is ample stock flowing
      through the warehouse to correct imbalances in the retailer inventories, and relatively
      minor variation in the demands themselves.
           There is strong empirical evidence that the approach does work well in such situa­
      tions. Typically, the cost of the heuristic policy (estimated by computer simulation) and
      the balanced approximation's cost lie within a few percent of each other, and hence both
      are close to the true optimal cost.


      8.6.3 Discussion
      Let us reflect for a moment on the mechanics of the heuristic policy: It bases warehouse
      orders and withdrawals entirely on the aggregate state variables ITPo(t) and ITP,(t), ig­
      noring the distribution of ITPlt) among the retailers. The fact that the policy performs well
      implies that these quantities capture the most crucial system characteristics for decisions
      at that level. The individual ITP/tJ are important, ofcourse, althe allocation level. It is only
      because myopic allocation manages them successfully that they can be ignored elsewhere.
            Also, although the heuristic policy seems quite different from a local base-stock pol­
      icy, the two operate similarly when the warehouse actually has inventory on hand. To see
      this, consider the identical-retailer case, assume that s~ > si> 0, and suppose we start
      at time 0 with inventory    st at the warehouse and none at the retailers. We immediately
      withdraw s~ and allocate it myopically, so that each ITPj(O) = sJ = s~/J. Notice, the
      C;(s')') are equal. Now, suppose a demand occurs. According to the policy, we withdraw
      an equal amount ofstock from the warehouse, if that much is available, or else all the re­
      maining warehouse stock. We allocate that stock, clearly, to the retailer where the de­
      mand occurred. because its Cj(ITPj(t)) is now smaller than the others. The net result is
      precisely the same as under a base-stock policy. This pattern continues until the ware­
      house runs out of stock. Only in response to warehouse backorders do the two policies
      differ. The local policy allocates using the FIFO rule, while the centralized policy uses
      myopic allocation, which better reflects current conditions at the retailers.
            Because the balanced approximation is accurate, the bounds of Section 8.3.6 and
      their interpretations all apply here. In particular, the performance of the system is
      strongly influenced by the parameters of Do and D" especially       "0   and"r'Now, Do is the
      total system demand over the warehouse's leadtime, and cr~ is its variance. [t is tempting
      to interpret Dr too as measuring systemwide leadtime demand. But D, is not ~'j Dj • It has
      the same mean, v" but ,,; is larger than V[~j DJ (They would be equal if, but only if,
      the Dj were perfectly correlated.) For instance, consider the identical-retailer case, where
      in particular the Dj have equal variances. Then, since the Dj are independent, we have
       V[~i Di] =  J"y,   but,,~ ~ J "J
                                     2

            This difference reflects the fact that, in the real system, retailer demands and inven­
      tories are not consolidated in a single location. (Even the balanced approximation does
      not actually pool the retailers. It aggregates the ITPj(t), not the I~(t). In other words, it
      begins with the cost rate (8.6.3), which already reflects the separation of the retailers.)
      We enjoy some of the economies of scale that such consolidation would provide, as re­
      flected in "0' but not all.

                  true. Simulation studies have shown that, even with h = 0, a small amount of warehouse
                  stock can sometimes improve performance. The optimal warehouse stock is smaller than
                  in a local-control system, though, and the performance improvement is slight. In sum,
                  warehouse inventory still plays a risk-pooling role under centralized control, but the ef­

      To understand this formula, consider two extreme cases: When                           Lb   =   0, the retailers
      operate independently, in effect, and each contributes its own cost to the total. In this
      case ()" = V"oJL;. Keeping the total demand rate                       "0
                                                               fixed, the overall cost is propor­
      tional to the square root of the number of retailers, as in the indvendent-item systems
      of Section 8.2. When     L;.
                              = 0, on the other hand, we have (T =    A.oL~; the total cost is
      independent of the number of retailers, as if their demands were consolidated at one
      location.
          The general case, where both Loand L; are positive, lies between these extremes.
      For a fixed totalleadtime La + L;, performance improves as La grows (and L; shrinks).
      Let us compare (8.6.8) to (8.5.5), the formula for the local-control system under similar
      assumptions. The first term V[BaJ there corresponds to "oLa here (since we carry no
      warehouse stock), and both expressions have the same last tenn, representing the retail­
      ers' leadtime-demand variances. The middle term (J - I )E[Ba] in (8.5.5), however, is
      entirely absent in (8.6.8). This term expresses retailer imbalances, which the balanced
      approximation approximates by zero. (As we have seen, this estimate is roughly correct,
      though it is a bit overoptimistic.) Thus, even a coupled system under centralized control
      achieves some, but not all, of the advantages of retailer consolidation. Centralized in­
      formation (here) and warehouse stock (in a local-control system) have somewhat simi­
      lar effects on perfonnance. In other words, a capable infonnation system serves as a par­
      tial substitute for inventory.
            Lee et al. [1993] describe an interesting application ofthese ideas to product design.
      The model describes Hewlett-Packard's logistics network for distributing printers to
      markets in Europe. The printers are produced in the United States, shipped to a central
      point in Europe (corresponding to the warehouse), and then distributed to the several
      countries (retailers). The printers destined for different countries require slightly differ­
      ent features (e.g., power supplies), and initially these differences were built in during the
      production process. In effect, each retailer operated independently. Its leadtime Li was

                                Then, a new approach was suggested: Make a common printer for all countries, and
                           insert the country-specific features only at the warehouse. This approach would allow
                           HP to decide the destination of a particular printer only on its arrival in Europe, not at

                           with the new approach, and partly for this reason the proposal was adopted.

           inventories now, but they may well slide out of balance in the future, long before the next
           order arrives.
                 Specifically, call the current time 0, and let us look ahead time I 2> 0. Denote vj(t) =
           aJ(t) = E[Dj(L; + I)] = I-;(L; + t). Ifwe allocate Sj to retailer), we would like the ftactiles

           equalz/t) for all t. (See Problem 8.18.) Myopic allocation continues to work well in this
           special case.
                 Otherwise, we must choose between balance now and balance later. For what time
           t :2: 0 wonld balanced inventories be most valuable? Consider the quantity s,. - v - "-of­
           (In case the Li are equal (to L;), this is just the expected total retailer net inventory at time
           L; + t, assuming no further orders arrive in the interim. In general this is E[l: (ITP;(f) ­
           DJi].) If this quantity is large, the system will have ample stock at tin,e f, and it does not
           matter where the resulting holding costs are incurred. Likewise, if s,. - v - Aot is small,
           the system will be plagued with backorders at t, and it is of no consequence whether they
           are evenly or unevenly spread among the locations. Imbalance hurts the most at the mo­
           ment the system runs out of stock, when this quantity hits zero, for then some retailers in­
           cur penalty costs at the same time that others pay holding costs. In short, we care most
           about imbalance for t ~ (s, - v)!l- o. (Actually, we need to revise this t slightly: Ifs,. < v,
           so twould otherwise be negative, reset f = 0. Also, there is no need to look beyond the next
           order arrival. So, if there is an outstanding order dne to arrive before t, reset t to that arrival
           time; if not.. compute the expected next arrival time, taking into account the number of de­
           mands needed to trigger the next order, and proceed accordingly.)
                 Then, use this f to redefine the myopic-allocation problem (8.6.4): Just replace Dj
           by D;(LJ + t) in the cost functions Cj . It makes sense to call this near-myopic allocation.
           With this adjustment the overall approach performs well. (Different adjustments are
           needed for other cases, when the warehouse does hold stock or when the retailer costs
           are unequal! but the key idea remains the same: Balance the retailer inventories at some
           appropriate future time t.)
                 What about fixed costs for internal shipments? Alas, we know ofno satisfactory ap­
           proach to this problem.


8.7 Shared Supply Processes
           This section discusses two types of shared supply processes. We cover the results briskly,
           only sketching certain ftuitful directions of analysis.


           8.7.1 The Joint-Replenishment Problem
           Let us revisit the joint-replenishment problem of Section 5.5, where several items are
           linked through economies of scope, specifically. through shared fixed order costs. We
           focus on one special case: Each time we order, we pay the fixed cost k, regardless ofthe
           composition of the order. In the terminology of Section 5.5, there is a major setup cost,
           but no minor setup costs. The demands for the items are independent Poisson processes
                                                                                                                      I! I'!I   I:'

      fully adapted here.

      8.7.2.1 No Scale Economies

      First, suppose there are no economies of scale in the system-no setup times or costs.

      Suppose we use the analogue of the local-control scheme of Section 8.5: Each item fol­

      lows a base-stock policy and sends orders to the production facility. The facility responds

      to these orders using the first come, first served (FCFS) discipline.

           For the moment. suppose the first symmetry condition above holds, so the items
      have identical processing requirements. (Because of the policy, the second condition is
      unnecessary.) The processing system itself has Poisson input, so it is relatively simple to
      analyze, as in Section 7.3. Then. binomially disaggregate its occupancy to obtain the out­
      standing orders for each item. as in Section 7.3.7. Finally, optimize each item's base­
      stock level separately. The identical-item case leads to a simple performance formula
      like (8.5.5); see Problem 8.19.
           This same approach can be used even without the symmetry condition, at least in
      some cases. For instance, suppose there is a single processor. The processing times Sj for
      itemj are i.i.d. random variables, but the S; may differ overj. It turns out that the pro­
      cessing system behaves like the M/G/l system of Section 7.3.2.2. Its overall processing
                        e
      time S is just the j weighted mixture ofthe S;. (In particular, E[S], E[S2], andE[S3] are
      the corresponding weighted averages of the E[Sj], E[SJ], and E[S;], respectively.) So,
      suppose we compute or approximate its occupancy, fO Dividing fO among the items re­
      quires a bit more care than before: Given fO = n > 0, each of the n - I units in the
                                                   e
      processor's queue has the same probability j of being an order for item j, so binomially
      disaggregate these units as before. The unit in process, however, has probability pip of
      belonging to itemj, where Pj ~ AjE[S;l and p = L; Pj' With this slight revision we can
      obtain the individual items' occupancies, and then proceed as above.
           Instead of this local approach, we may prefer a centralized control scheme, along
      the lines of Section 8.6. Let us focus on the single-processor case. When both symme­
      try conditions above apply, we must allocate each unit of finished product as it emerges
      from the processor; otherwise, we allocate not stock but rather processor time. In both
      cases, analogues of myopic allocation seem to work well. With identical products, again,
      myopic allocation reduces to a simpler rule: When it comes time to allocate, whether
      stock or processing time, choose that product with the lowest net inventory. (In fact, this
      rule is truly optimal.)
           There remains the decision when to operate the processor and when to shut it down.
      the analogue here of the warehouse's ordering decision. The following simple heuristic,
      essentially a base-stock policy, seems to work well: Monitor some aggregate measure of
      inventory, and turn the processor on when that measure falls below some fixed base­
      stock level; likewise, turn the processor offwhen the measure equals or exceeds the base­
      stock level. (lu the identical-product case, the appropriate measure is total net inventory.)
      Also, one can determine a good value of the base-stock level and global performance
      measures, in the spirit of the balanced approximation.

                    can conceive of and analyze only rather crude heuristic policies.

                         We sketch one approach, which extends the local-control policy above: Each prod­

          mind when selecting the aggregate resource cost K. This parameter must reflect not just
          direct resource-usage costs, but also indirect congestion effects. There is no simple rule
          to accomplish this, to our knowledge, so it may be necessary to iterate. That is, if we

8.8 Kanban Systems
          8.8.1 Definition
          Kanban is a Japanese word meaning card or ticket. A kanban s_vstem is a production­
          control scheme that uses cards in a special way to regulate the flow of goods between
          stages. The idea was developed originally at Toyota Motors. The kanban system, along
          with other innovations in operations, has been one of the key factors underlying Toyota"5
          remarkable growth over the last few decades. It is now widely used throughout industry
          in Japan and the rest ofthe world.
                First we describe the mechanics of the kanban system. Then, we explore a more gen­
          eral control scheme. Finally, we discuss the kanban system in the broader context of the
          just-in-time approach to operations.
                To illustrate the concept, consider a series system. Each stage's supply system con­
          sists of a single, finite-capacity processor and its queue. Demands occur one at a time,
          and there are no scale economies, so goods move through the system in individual units.
          (Actually, the scheme can work just as well in more complex system structures, and/or
          with larger batch sizes. As we shall see, however, the kanban system's maiu virtue is its
          effectiveness in dealing with capacity limits; it makes little sense in the context of an
          infinite-capacity supply system, like the exogenous and independent-Ieadtime models.)
                Figure 8.8.1 depicts the subsystem associated with a single stage, including the in­
          ventory itself, the processor, and the processor's queue. There is also a box (sometimes
          called a post or a bulletin board), where cards arc stored temporarily.
                Each stage has a fixed, positive number of cards, which circulate around the sub­
          system. The key rule is this: At all times, every unit of stock in the subsystem must have
          one of these cards attached to it. Any additional cards are kept in the box.
                Consider stage J. Suppose all of its cards are attached to units in inventory (so the
          processor, its queue, and the box must be empty). Now, suppose a demand occurs. We
          use one unit of inventory to fill the demand. As that unit departs, we detach its card and
          put it in the box. The card waits there, if stage J - 1 has no inventory available. When
          stage J - 1 does have inventory, we take one of those units, attach the card from the box,
          and place them together in stage J's qucue. Since that queue is empty and the processor
          is idle, the unit moves immediately into the processor, which begins to work on it. (Had
          the processor been occupied, the unit would have waited its turn in the queue.) Once pro­
          cessing is complete, the finished unit, with its card still attached, moves into inventory.
          The cycle then begins anew.
                The other stages work similarly: A card begins its cycle attached to a unit in inven­
          tory. When the unit is sent from inventory to the next stage, the card is detached and
          placed in the box. Only when there is a card available in the box can a unit be drawn from

ISOIldJuMs              backlogged; no card moves into the box. In this situation, then, a customer demand does

                             The kanban system, then, is a particular type of policy, a rule specifying what to do
~.• §O . .              under various circwnstances. It is similar in many ways to a base-stock policy: Both are

lScanI_                 information propagates backwards through the network, stage by stage, from the last to

JIll                    stage always triggers a demand at the prior stage. The kanban system, in contrast,
Oocepro­                generates a demand upstream when the stage fills one of its own demands. Thus, the
Iu\~.                   demand-propagation mechanisms are the same when (but only when) the stage has
                        inventory on hand; backlogged demands do not propagate upstream under the kanban
[inIm~                  system until later. Consequently, the number of cards has yet another role in the

354   Foundations of [m'enf01y Management


           This is the primary strength of the kanban policy. For instance, consider a two-stage
      system, where the first stage has a fast processor, but the second's processor is slower.
      Under a base-stock policy the queue at the second stage grows rapidly. No matter how
      large it gets) the policy instructs stage 1 to continue producing units and transmitting
      them to stage 2, as subsequent demands occur. The kanban policy, however, blocks the
      flow ofunits into stage 2 when it becomes too congested; equivalently, the policy blocks
      the transmission of demands to stage 1, and this ultimately stops stage 1's processor. In
      this way the kanban approach avoids excessive queues.
           It should be clear that the basic logic here does not require the use of cards. We can
      use any other physical tokens instead. Some companies implement the policy with
      painted circles on the floor, marking the legal spaces in the queue; here, every unit in the
      queue must rest on one of these circles. Other firms embed the idea in a computer pro­
      gram; the logical equivalents of cards are sometimes called electronic kanbans.
           (Suggestion: To make sure you understand the kanban mechanism, simulate manu­
      ally the operation of a two- or three-stage system. Use pennies to represent physical
      units, and make cards out of paper, using a different color for each stage. You will also
      need markers, say dimes, to represent backlogged customer demands. Variation: Play
      this game with several friends. Choose one player to simulate customer demands; each
      ofthe others operates a single stage.)


      8.8.2 The Generalized Kanban Policy
       The kanban system is not perfect. Again consider a two-stage system, but now stage I
       has a slow processor, and stage 2's is relatively fast. We need little inventory at stage 2,
       so it makes sense to assign it only a few cards. But this also sharply limits the occupancy
       at stage 2. Consequently, stage I's processor will frequently stop working, even when
       there are many customer backorders. And since stage 1 responds slowly to its demands,
       stage 2's processor will often run out of work to do. To reduce such forced idleness, we
       can increase the number of cards at stage 2, but then stage 2's inventory may become too
       large. In contrast, base-stock policies allow us to regulate inventories precisely, while
       freely transmitting demand information to heavily loaded stages, where it is needed
       most.
             Both the kanban and base-stock policies, then, have weaknesses as well as strengths.
       We now describe a more general class of policies, which includes the kanban and base­
       stock policies as special cases, and which captures the best features of both. Recall, in a
       kanban system, the number of cards in a stage affects its behavior in two ways, limiting
       both the inventory and the supply-system occupancy. The idea here is to separate these
       two roles, assigning them to different policy variables. We call this a generalized kanban
      policy.
             Again uses; ~ 0 to denote the base-stock level, i.e., the maximum inventory, at stage
      j. Also, define
                            ni =   supply-system occupancy limit for stage j
      This is a positive integer. These two policy variables can be set independently.

                            The generalized kanban policy provides considerable freedom to modulate per­
                      formance. Each sJ has essentially the same impact as in a base-stock policy; as we in­
                      crease it, we obtain better protection against backorders at the cost oflarger inventories.
                      Each Ilj too affects inventory and backorders, but less directly. It mediates the backward

           To illustrate, consider a m'o-stage system with Poisson demand and limited-capacity

      The table has three parts, (a) to (e). The systems descrihed in the three parts differ in
      their processing rates ILr Part (a) describes a base case with ILj ~ 2, so Pi = ~. Parts (b)        0.8	      2O!

           It is striking to observe that, in nearly all cases, the base-stock levels sJ are identical               10       I

      across the three policy types; the occasional differences are slight. The overall costs too
      are qnite close. [The greatest differences appear in part (b) ofthe table, descrihing a slow
      stage-2 processor. This is precisely where we expect an occupancy limit to help the most.

           Thus, the simple model of Section 8.3 seems to capture the fundamental economics
      ofthe system. The base-stock levels play the same roles in all three policies, with or with­
      out occupancy limits. This observation suggests using algorithm (8.3.9) as a heuristic
      method to determine the sJ in a kanban or a generalized kanban policy.
           Notice also that, in the generalized kanban policy, 112 and s~ are quite different in
      many cases; nz is mnch smaller in part (b), but larger in part (e). Moreover, they respond
      to parameter changes differently_ For instance, s~ is very sensitive to the backorder cost
      b, but n2 is not; conversely, n2 is much more sensitive than s~ to !-Lt-

      as tentative.


      8.8.3 Analysis
      There are a few tractable approximations for policy evaluation in the research literature.
      (See the Notes at the end of the chapter.) These are based on methods for finite-buffer
      processing networks.


      8.8.4 The Larger Context: The Just-in-TimeApproach
      As we have seen, the kanban system is a local information and control system. All de­
      cisions are based on local infonnation; the transmission of infonnation, moreover,
      requires only short communication links (i.e., between successive stages). The mecha­
      nism is simple. The information itself and the rules that employ it are easy to describe
      and implement. Finally, the approach is rang;ble. At any moment, anyone-a worker or
      an observer-can see just what must be done.
            We have seen other control schemes with these features. A base-stock policy is also
      local, simple, and tangible; so are a generalized kanban policy and a local (r, q) policy.
      It was only with the introduction of the kanban system, however, and the celebrated suc­
      cesses ofToyota and other companies using it, that we learned just how important these
      factors are. It was in contrast to the kanban system that the weaknesses of centralized
      control schemes like MRl', as discussed in Chapter 5, showed up clearly.
            The kanban system is only one element of a broad approach to operations manage­
      ment calledjust-in-time (or JIT). Another key element is kaizen, a Japanese word that
      means continuous improvement. The idea here is to tinker with equipment and proce­
      dures so that they work better. Over time, many small reductions in setup times, pro­
      cessing times, and defects can add up to a much more capable process and vastly im­
      proved perfonnance. Kaizen is everyone's responsibility. Even factory workers whose
      usual job is just to get work out the door should participate, for the people closest to the
      process can sometimes see problems and solutions that are invisible to others.
            The kanban system addresses moment-to-moment control, while kaizen operates              Notes
      over a longer time scale. How are they cOfmected? The main connection is psychologi­
      cal, or perhaps sociological: A local control system, precisely because it is transparent,
      supports the perception that the process belongs to everyone, and thus reinforces kaizen.
      This is no automatic mechanism, however; people don't work that way. A local control
      scheme cannot by itself engender kaizen; that requires training and incentives, not to
      mention patience. Conversely, an active kaizen program can survive some degree of cen­
      tralized control.
            In short, there is no need to apply the principle oflocal control dogmatically; indeed
      it is foolish and dangerous to do so. Some longer communication links and more com­
      plex information are virtually always required.

           Section 8.3: The study of series systems with stochastic demand and constant leadtimes
           was initiated by Clark and Scarf [1960] and later refined by Federgrueu and Zipkin
           [1984c], Rosling [1989], and Chen and Zheug [1994b]. The two-moment approximation
           is by Graves [1985].
                The extension of the policy-evaluation scheme in Section 8.3.4 to exogenous, sto­
           chastic leadtimes is attributable to Svoronos and Zipkin [1991]. Buzacott et a1. [1992],
           Lee and Zipkin [1992,1995] and Zipkin [1995] develop the approximation for limited­
           capacity supply systems; Graves [1985] and Sherbrooke [1986] develop the independ­
           ent-Ieadtime approximation. Gallego and Zipkin [1999a] observe that the optimization
           algorithm can be used in these contexts. Song and Zipkin [1992] extend the policy-eval­

8.18 Section 8.6.5 discusses a coupled system with identical retailer costs and a fixed cost for external
     orders. In this setting. the myopic allocation rule must be revised, in general. When the retailers are
     identical, however, no revision is necessary. Explain why. That is, argue first that, if the Zj(O) are
     identicaloverj, so are the Zj(t) for all t. Secoud, suppose we revise problem (8.6.4), replacing Dj by
     DJ (L; + t) in the cost functions Ci Show that the new problem is equivalent to the original.
         Extend this Idea to the case of compound-Poisson demands. Now, vj(t) ~ AjE[lj](L; + t) and
     crJ(t) ~ AjE[Y;](L; + t). Show that the results above remain true for identical retailers, and more

     generally when the L; and the ratios E[YJ]/Aj E [lj] are equal over j.
8.19 Consider the shared-production-capacity system of Section 8.7.2.1 with no economies of scale,
     local control, and identical products. Suppose we are able to determine the distribution of fO, the
     overall occupancy of the processor, and we then apply binomial disaggregation to obtain fOJ , the
     occupancy of item j's orders. Finally, approximate fOj with a normal distribution. Show that the
     total optimal cost is proportional to q:, where q:2 = V[fO] + (J - I)E[fO). Compare this formula
     with (8.5.5).
8.20 This problem extends the modeling approach of Section 8.7.2.2 to the case of nonidentical
     products and stochastic processing times: Item j has Poisson demand with rate Aj and follows an
     (r, q) policy with variables (Ij, q). Its processing time Sj includes a random setup time Tj and a
     random unit processing time Pj; all these times are independent, even for the units within a batch.
     Approximate each item"s orders by a POiSSOU process. Now, as explained in Section 8.7.2.1, the
     production facility becomes an MlGII system.

            (Use the summary parameter p.)
      (c)	 Let L Q denote the time spent waiting in the queue itself (the total time L less the actual
            processing time). In our terms equation (7.3.2) can be written as E[L Q] = l'£l,E[S2]/(l - l!). So,
            write the simplest expression you can for £l,E[s'], again using the data and the qj' (It is possible
            to obtain a similar formula for V[L Q ). Instead, approximate V[L Q ] by E 2[L Q ].)

9.1 Introduction
           Tbis chapter explores situations where demand is subject to both predictable and unpre­
           dictable variations. The scenario thus combines features that we studied separately in
           Chapters 4 and 6.
                 We begin in Section 9.2 with a heuristic analysis ofa few extreme cases, in the same
           spirit as Section 4.2. Apart from that initial section, the primary goal in this chapter is to
           prove rigorously that the optimal policy takes on a certain form, depending on the de­
           tails ofthe system. We have done nothing of the kind until now. In Chapter 6, for exam­
           ple, we argued that a base-stock policy is plausible under certain conditions, but here we
           show that, under similar conditions, it is truly the best among all possible policies.
               To achieve this ambitious aim, along with the greater generality of time-dependent
           demand, we adopt a discrete-time formulation, as in Chapter 4, where all important
           events occur at prespecified time points. Also, we introduce the concept of dynamic pro­
           gramming, a powerful mode of formulation, analysis, and computation.



                                                                                                     367

                       Here is the plan: Section 9.3 describes the basic setup. The costs in the model are
                 just like those assumed previously-fixed and variable order costs, a holding cost for in­
                 ventory, and a penalty cost for backorders. The demand at each time point is a random
                 variable, whose distribution is a function oftime. The demands at different points are in­
                 dependent (until Section 9.7).
                      Section 9.4 treats the special case without economies of scale, that is, with a linear
                 order cost. The optimal policy is indeed a base-stock policy. It uses a distinct base-stock
                 level for each time point. Otherwise, it works just like the base-stock policy of
                 Chapter 6. It is not easy to calculate the optimal base-stoek levels, so we explore a sim­
                 ple approximation, called the myopic policy, which often works well. This myopic ap­
                 proach is an important one, and we use it throughout the chapter. When the data are sta­
                 tionary, the optimal base-stock level too becomes stationary, as in Chapter 6.
                      The same policy structure remains optimal for certain variations of the basic model,
                 namely, for lost sales instead of backorders, and for the broader objective of profit in­
                 stead of cost. For imperfect supply quality, however, a base-stock policy is not optimal.
                 We need to consider a larger class of rules called inflated base-stock policies.
                      In Section 9.5 the order cost includes a fixed component as well as a linear one.
                 Here, an (r, s) policy is optimal. With time-varying data, both rand s change over time.
                 In the infinite-horizon, stationary setting, a stationary (r, s) policy is optimal.
                      The models of Sections 9.3 to 9.5 have a minimalleadtime. Section 9.6 shows that the
                 results remain valid for any constant leadtime., and also with sequential stochastic leadtimes.
                 Here, finally. we have full analogues in discrete time of the continuous-time models of
                 Chapters 6 and 7. We point out in Section 9.6.4 that simple structured policies are optimal
                 in the continuous-time setting also. (These results do not extend to lost sales, however.)
                      The remainder of the chapter extends these results in various directions. Section 9.7
                 examines a system with world-driven demand, the discrete-time analogue of the com­
                 plex demand process of Section 6.3, where the distribution ofdemand in each period de­
                 pends on the current state of the world, The earlier results remain valid with minimal ad­
                 justments. With a linear order cost, for example, a base-stock policy is still optimal, but
                 the optimal base-stock level reflects the current state of the world as well as time.
                      Section 9.8 treats a series system in discrete time, With linear shipment costs, an
                 echelon-base-stock policy is optimal.


     9.2 Extreme Cases
                 Suppose demand is a Poisson process, but its rate A ~ A(t) is a known function of time.
                 The cumulative demand D(t), it turns out, has a Poisson distribution with mean E[D(t)]
                 = fbA(V) dv. Otherwise, the setup is like that of Chapter 6; the cost factors and the lead­
                 time are constant. The goal is to analyze a few special cases, approximately and heuris­
                 tically, as in Section 4.2.

                 have negligible effects on the demand process, as in the deterministic models of Sec­

           Under this heuristic the base-stock level moves in parallel with the mean leadtime
      demand. This is the simplest way to account for demand changes, and it is used widely
      in practiee. Moreover, apart from the order-cost term cl.(t), the cost rate C*(t) remains
      constant.
          Now, suppose there is a positive fixed cost k > O. The analogue of the myopic ap­
      proach above is this: Use an (r, q) policy with time-dependent policy variables ret) and q(t).
      Choose these variables to minimize a cost function that combines (6.5.16) with (9.2.1):

                                 qt, r, q - )_(1)q [kl.(t) +   w+q
                                                               "',~,+ I   qt, s)]

      This method should work well provided the demand rate changes slowly, for the same
      reasons as in Section 4.2.3.
            Or, set ret) and q(t) using the simpler heuristics mentioned in Section 6.5.3. For in­
      stance, set q(t) ~ [2kl.(t)/hw] 1/2 by analogy to (4.2.1), and ret) = s + (t) - I3q(t) for some
      reasonable fraction 13.
            Or, even more crudely, fix q(t) to some average value q, use some average rr _ of
      rr(t), approximate set) ~ vet) + rr _z* as above, and set ret) = set) - I3q(t) = vet) +
      (rr _z* - I3q). Adjust q and rr _ only in response to a substantial demand change. Here,
      the reorder point moves in parallel with the mean leadttme demand. This simple tech­
      nique too is popular in practice.
           Here is one way to estimate the average cost: Approximate C*(t) = qt, ret), q(t)]
      for each t separately, using the bounds of Theorem 6.5.1 together with the normal or
      maximal approximation. Then, average over time as in (9.2.2).

                                                                                                                ,

      The same ideas extend directly to systems with stochastic leadtimes, generated by either an
      independent-parallel or an exogenous-sequential supply process. Again, small and/or fast
      demand changes can be ignored, while slow changes can be handled by a myopic approach.
          In the exogenous-sequential case, for instance, redefine D(tIL) to be the leadtime de­
      mand starting at time t, i.e., the demand between t and t + L, where now L is the mar­
      ginalleadtime, a random variable. In general, D(tIL) is no longer Poisson, nor does it
      have any other any simple form, but we can approximate: Compute its mean and vari­
      ance vet) and rr\t) (Problem 9.1), and fit a standard distributional form, such as a nor­
      mal or a gamma. Then, proceed with the methods above.
           Recall, this supply system has unlimited capacity, and that makes it tractable. A
      finite-capacity supply process requires more care: Small and/or fast demand-rate
      changes can again be ignored. Slow changes too can be treated as above, but only when
      the changes are very slow, and the demand rate stays well below the system's capacity.
           For instance, consider an MIMI! system with processing rate J.L. The direct analogue
      ofthe myopic approach sets pet) = I.(t)/"" and replaces D(tIL) in (9.2.1) by a geometric

                                capacity or changes faster than the supply system? First, if the base-stock level s(t) is

           x(t) = net inventory at time t, t = 0, ... , T
      The initial net inventory is the constant xo.
          The sequence of events at each time t < T is as follows:

           I. Wc observe the net inventory x(t).
           2. We decide the order size z(t).
      Then, sometime during period t, the demand d(t) occurs and the order z(t) arrives. The
      system dynamics are described by equations identical in form to (4.3.2):
                          x(t   + I)   = x(l)   + z(t)   - d(t)   t = 0, ... , T- I        (9.3.1)

      At the horizon Twe observe xCI), but that is all; there is no order z(T) or demand d(I).
            This model is usually described in the literature as having a leadtime of zero. We
      haven't said exactly when orders arrive, and we don't really need to; (9.3.1) remains valid
      as long as each order arrives during its own period. If z(t) arrives at the very end of pe­
      riod t, however, it makes sense to call the leadtime 1, not O. This usage is consistent with
      Section 9.6, where we introduce an explicit leadtime. Whatever we call it, the leadtime
      is certainly short. Remember, a period can be very short, especially when the discrete­
      time model is constructed to approximate a continuous one. So, the model is quite spe­
      cial. Fortunately, virtually all the results carry over to more realistic models with longer
      leadtimes, as shown in Section 9.6.
            The nature of the decision problem is quite different from that of Chapter 4. There,
      because the d(t) were known in advance, we could determine the z(t) all at once. Here,
      we choose each z(t) at point t, based on what we know at step 2. At that moment, we know
      x(t), which reflects all past demands, but not d(t) or any later demands. It makes no sense
      to specify z(t) any earlier, for that would ignore useful information.
            What we want, then, is not a set of fixed decisions, but rather an order policy, a
      rule for making decisions based on current information. In contrast to Chapter 6, we
      place no advance restrictions on the form of the policy. One of our primary goals is to
      determine which type o.fpolicy is best, given the economics of the situation. Accord­
      ingly, we bypass the analysis of physical performance measures, such as average back­
      orders. The costs associated with inventory, backorders, etc., enter the formulation
      from the beginning.


      9.3.2 Costs
      The cost parameters are

           k(t) = fixed order cost at time t
           crt) = unit variable order cost at time t
           h(t) ~ inventory-holding cost rate at time t
           b(t) = backorder-penalty cost rate at time t

             -y = discount factor, < -y s I

      Future costs are discounted at rate "I, as in Section 4.4.2. The cost factors indicate the
      original, undiscounted costs; unlike Section 4.4.2, we do not replace k(t) f- -ytk(t), etc.

                     cost is assessed onx(t) at step I oftime t. This cost can be written compactly as Crt, x(t»,

                     9.3.3 Salvage Value
                     Sometimes, when T is finite, it is convenient to include a special mechanism to "settle
                     accounts" at the end. Specifically, when x(T) < 0, we must purchase stock to fill the re­
                     maining backorders -x(T) at the unit purchase price crT). (Remember, the last real or­
                     der is at time T - I, so the meaning of crT) is unambiguous. There is no fixed cost for
                     such purchases, i.e., k(T) ~ 0.) Also, if x(T) > 0, we can sell the leftover stock at the
                     same price; thus, we receive total revenue c(T)x(T), or equivalently, we pay a cost of
                      -c(T)x(T). In sum, regardless of the sign ofx(T), there is a tenninal cost -c(T)x(T).
                          The tenninal-cost factor crT) is called the salvage value. Actually, we can do with­
                     out it; we achieve the same effect by adding crT) to beT) and subtracting the same

9.4 Linear Order Costs
           This section assumes that all k(l) = O. Thus, the cost to order z at time I is the linear func­
           tion C(I)z, z". O.
                We treat the problem in three parts, depending on the horizon T. First, we analyze a
           model with only two time points and one period, that is, with T ~ I. Then, we extend the
           model to an arbitrary finite horizon. Finally, we consider an infinite horizon. In all these
           cases, it turns out, a base-stock policy is optimal.
                Following that, we study three important extensions, namely, lost sales, profit max­
           imization, and imperfect quality. The problems at the end of the chapter explore other
           extensions.


           9.4.1 The Single-Period Problem
          With T ~ I the problem is as follows: We must make a single order decision at time O.
          During period 0 a random demand occurs and the order arrives. At time I the inventory­
          backorder cost C(1, x(1) is assessed and the terminal cost is realized. That's all. Because
          there is only one time period, we suppress the time index t. That is, we abbreviate
          xo ~ x, d(O) = d, yeO) = y, c(O) = c, h(1) ~ h, b(1) = b, C(1, x) = C(x), and C(O,y) =
          E[C(y - d)] = C(y). We continue to use c(1) for the salvage value, if any.
               This may seem an artificially simple scenario, but it accurately portrays situations
          where the product has a short useful life. Examples include newspapers, magazines, and
          many foods and beverages. In fact, this is sometimes called the newsboy or newsvendor
          problem. In these applications the initial net inventory x (= xo) is most likely 0, but we
          allow x to have any value. (This generality will be helpful later.)
               To choose the order quantity, we aim to balance the order cost, the inventory­
          backorder cost, and the terminal cost. Viewed from step 2 of time point 0, the discounted
          expected tenninal cost at time I is
                                      )'E[ -c(l)x(l)    1=   -)'c(l)(y - E[d])
           Thus, we face the following optimization problem in the single variable y:
                              Minimize          c(y - x)   + C(y)   - )'c(l)(y - E[d])
                              subject to        y=::x                                              (9.4.1)

           This is easy to solve for any given x. To detennine an optimal policy, however, we must
           solve (9.4.1) for every value of x.

               Define

                                     H(y)   = cy + C(y)      - )'c(l)(y - E[d])
                                            = )'c(l)E[d]     + c+y + C(y)
          where c + = C - )'c(l). The objective of(9.4.I) isH(y) - cx, and the term ex is constant,
          so we can equivalently minimize H(y). Recall, C is a convex function, and the other
          terms in H are linear, so H too is convex. Let s· be the smallest y that minimizes H(y)

      how can we intelligently select yeO)? And then there is y(2), which should probably de­
      pend on y( I) and yeO), or maybe it's the other way around.... We seem to be trapped!
            Fortlmately, there is a way out. Tbis is precisely the sort of dilemma addressed by
      dynamic programming. The key idea is to think backward in time.
           Consider time point T - 1. Once we arrive there, no matter what may have happened
      in the past, we sball face a single-period problem like the one above. We know bow to
      solve that problem. The optimal base-stock policy tells us the best yeT - I) for any
      x(T - I).
           Next, suppose we find ourselves at time T - 2. We face a two-period problem. To
      account for the future, assume tbat we shall act optimally at T - I, according to the pol­
      icy obtained already. With this infonnation, as we shall see, we can detennine the best
      yeT - 2) for all x(T - 2).
           At time T - 3, assume that we shall act optimally at bOlh future points. Again, we
      can use this information to optimize yeT - 3). Continue working backward in this way,
      all the way to point I ~ O. At that point, we can detennine the best y(O) for the actual
      x(O) ~ Xo.
            The fact that this approach works is sometimes called the principal ofoptimality. It
      should be intuitively clear, and it can be proven rigorously.
           Here is a precise statement of the approach: Define the following functions for
      t = 0, ... , T:

           V(I, x)   = minimal expected discounted cost in periods I, I +   I, ... , T, assuming
                        period I begins with x(l)   ~   x

                  We compute these functions recursively. In the process, we obtain the optimal policy.
                  First (or rather, last),
                                                            V(T, x)   =   -c(T)x	                        (9.4.3)

                  Suppose we have determined Vet + I, x), along with the optimal policies for points
                  I + I through T - I. To address the prohlem at time t. given x(l) ~ x. define

                  This quantity measures all the relevant costs if we choose y(l) ~ y. The first two terms
                  (minus the constant C(I)x) represent the costs at time I itself. The last term is the expected
                  value of all future costs, assuming we act optimally in the future. since x(t + 1) =
                  y - d(I). The problem at point t, then, is to choose y to minimize H(I, y), subject to
                  y ~ x. The solution to this problem for each x gives the optimal policy at time I. Then set
                                            V(t, x)   ~   -c(t)x   + min {H(I, y) : y   ~   x}           (9.4.5)
                  Now, using V(t, .), we can proceed to compute V(t - 1, .) in the same way, then V(I - 2, '),
                  and so on.
                       Equations (9.4.4) and (9.4.5), together with the boundary or terminal condition
                  (9.4.3), describe a recursive scheme to compute the optimal-cost functions for all time
                  points, as well as the optimal policy. They arefimctional equations, i.e., equations whose
   I              unknowns are the functions V(I, .) and H(I, -). This model is often called the dynamic­
                  programmingfonnulalion of the problem. [Dynamic progranuning and oplimal control

 addressed by          We're done, in principle. In practice, however, two difficulties arise:
                       First, x andy are continuous variables, and so, for each t, (9.4.4) prescribes an infi­
ave happened      nite number of expectations, and (9.4.5) an infinite number of optimizations. To solve
knowhow to        functional equations of this kind typically requires numerical approximation techniques.
- I) for any      One approach, the simplest conceptually, is to discretize and tnmcate the state space: Se­

IIg to the pol­        Second, the full optimal policy (the best y for every x and I, written out, say, in a

                  Parts (b) and (c) follow immediately, just as in the one-period model.

      By the way, one can also show that H(I, y) and V(I, y) are continuously differentiable in
      y. SO, S*(I) solves H'(t, y) = O. (Here, H' is the derivative with respect to y,)
           In sum, the optimal policy is characterized by a single parameter, the base-stock
      level S*(I), for each time point. In general, however, it is not easy to compute the s*(I),
      Even koowing the form ofthe optimal policy, we still must perform the recursive calcu­
      lations indicated in (9.4.3) to (9.4.5) using numerical techniques.


      9.4.3 The Myopic Policy
      We can obtain useful and interesting information about the s*(t) by means of a slight
      transformation ofthe problem: Define

                      V+(I, x) = c(l)x    + V(I, x)        IS; T

                         c+(I) = c(l) - 'Yc(1   +     I)
                      C+(t, y) = 'Yc(1    + I)E[d(I)] + c +(I)y + ql, y)       1< T

      The following recursion is equivalent to (9.4.3) to (9.4.5):

                          V+(T, x) ~ 0                                                      (9.4.6)

                            H(I,y) = C+(I,y)        + 'YE[V+(I + l,y - d(I»]                (9.4.7)

                           V+(I, x) = min {H(t, y) : y '" x}                                (9.4.8)

      (problem 9.2 asks you to verify the alternative expression for H in (9.4.7).) Evidently,
      V+(t, x) plays the same role here as V+ (x) in the single-period problem, Indeed, we can
      write
                                    V+(I, x) ~ H(I, max {s*(t),x})                          (9.4.9)

           Now, C+ plays the role of the current period's cost in this transformed model. Let
      s+(I) be the smallest value ofy that minimizes C+(I, y). The corresponding base-stock
      policy minimizes the current cost while ignoring the future, so we call it the myopic pol­
      icy. Because C+ (t, y) is just the actual one-period cost C(I, y) plus a linear function of y
      and a constant, it is convex, and so easy to optimize. In particular, s +(t) solves an equa­
      tion of the same form as (9.4,2):

                                     °         c+(I) + h(1 + 1)
                                                                                           (9.4.10)
                                   FdV)(y) = b(1 + 1) + h(1 + I)

          This is essentially the same approach outlined in Section 9.2.2 in the continuous­
      time setting with a slow-changing demand rate. s +(1) reflects the data for period I in a
      simple manner, like s* in a one-period model. For instance, suppose the cost factors are
      stationary, we approximate d(l) using a normal distribution, denote V(I) ~ E[d(I)] and
      0'\1) = V[d(I)], and set z* to solve q,o(z) ~ (c++ h)/(b + h). Then, s +(1) ~ v(l) +
      O'(I)z*, and C+(I, s+(I» = cV(I) + O'(I)(b + h)q,(z*).
           The myopic and optimal policies are closely related:

                        Theorem 9.4.2 part (a) tells us that the true optimal base-stock level always lies al
                   or below the myopic level, never above; taking the future into account can only reduce
                   the base-stock level. By part (b), the two levels coincide unless S+(I) > s*(1 + I). The
ans of a slight
                   only reason we might choose s*(I) < S +(t) is to reduce the chance that x(1 + 1) >
                   S*(I + I) in the next period, and that concern is relevant only when s*(I + I) is smaiL
                   Indeed, by part (e), s*(I) is bounded below by the smallest subsequent myopic leveL
                   These results together imply that, if the s +(I) are nondecreasing in I. then s*(I) ~ s+(I)
                   for all I, i.e., the myopic policy is optimaL (See Problem 9.3.)
                         Parts (e) and (d) tell us that the general pattern of changes in the S*(I) follows
                   elosely that of the S +(t). When S +(t) goes down, so does s*(I). When S +(I) goes up, so
                   does S*(I), unless we anticipate a decrease later on (i.e., unless s*(1 + I) > s*(1 + 2)).
         (9.4.6)   Thus, since the S +(t) closely reflect changes in the data. so do the S*(I), but less directly;
                   the s*(I) also anticipate future changes.
         (9.4.7)         Also, when s*(1 + I) < S +(1), we are more likely to find s*(I) < S +(t) when V[d(I)]
         (9.4.8)   is large relative to E[d(l)). The theorem doesn't directly support this statement, but the
                   intuitive interpretation above does: If E[d(I)] is large but V[d(I)] is small, then there is
7).) Evidently,    little uncertainty in x(l + I) giveny(I); even setting y(l) ~ s +(1), we can be fairly sure
ndeed, we can      that x(1 + 1):$ s*(1 + I). if V[d(I)] is large, however, there is a greater chance that d(l)
                   will be small, hence x(1 + I) > s*(1 + I). To avoid that, the model pushes s*(I) down.

      EXAMPLE 9.4.A

      We shall solve fOUf models. In all cases, T = 5, 'Y = 1, and the holding and penalty costs are con­
      stant at h(l) = 1, bet) = 9. The demands d(t) have either Poisson or geometric distributions.
            First, consider a pair of systems with constant C(l), so every c+(t) = O. The mean demand
      E[d(t)] stays constant at 40 until time 3, when it abruptly drops to 2, and remains eonstant there­
      after. The systems differ only in their demand distributions, Poisson or geometric. Figure 9.4.2 dis­
      plays the optimal and myopic policies.
            In the Poisson-demand model, s*(t) = S + (l) for all t; the myopic policy is optimal. In the geo­
      metric case, we see that s*(3) = s +(3) = s*(4) = s + (4), as expected, but s*(2) < s \2) and even
      s*(I) < s + (l), anticipating the drop in demand at time 3. It is remarkable, however, that the dif­
      ferences are so small. These anticipation effects die out at time 0, where again s*(O) = s + (0).
            Next, consider a pair of systems with constant mean demand E[d(t)] = 30. The order costs
      e(t) change, however; they follow a general downward trend with fluctuations along the way. Fig­
      ure 9.4.3 shows the results.
            We see that s + (t) is large when we anticipate a higher cost in the next period, i.e.. c(t) <
      c(t + 1), so c+(t) < 0, and small in the opposite case. The s*(t) follow the same pattern. Indeed
      only for t = 0 and 2 do we observe s*(t) < s + (t). Even then, the differences are slight, except in
      the geometric-demand case for t = O.
            In these four cases, the myopic policy is almost always nearly optimal. Such a close relation
      is typical. The myopic policy can be far from optimal, but only when the problem data change rap­
      idly over time.

                            The myopic approach also provides a simple lower bound on the optimal cost: Let
                       7T denote any policy. The total expected cost starting with x(O) = x using policy 7T can
                       be written

                                   V(O, X]7T) = E[l;~J-y'{ c(t)(y(t) - x(t))         + C(t, yet)))   - "/c(Tlx(T)]

                       Eachy(t) here is determined by the policy andx(t). The demands play an implicit role,
                       through x(t + I) = yet) - d(t). Using this identity to eliminate thex(t) for t > 0, we get
                                                     V(O,X]7T) = E[ l;~J'YtC+(t,y(t))] - c(Olx

                       Equivalently, letting V+(O, XI7T) = V(O, X]7T)           + c(O)x
                                                          V+(O,X]7T) = E[l;~J'YtC+(t, yet))]

                       Now, s +(t) minimizes C+(t, y). Consequently, V+(O, XI7T) '" V_CO) for all x, where
                                                             V_CO) ~ l;~htc+(t, s +(t))

                       This is true, in particular, for the optimal policy; i.e., V+ (0, x) '" V_(0). With stationary
                       cost parameters, llllder the nonnal approximation, the lower bound becomes

                                                 V_CO) = cl;~J'Ytv(t)        + (b + h)",(z')l;~o"Yt(T(t)
                            In fact, V_CO) provides a good approximation of V+(O, x), at least for not-too-Iarge
                       x, precisely when the myopic policy is close to the optimal one, i.e., usually. This is the
                       discrete-time analogue of the cost approximation of Section 9.2.2.

      9.4.4 The Infinite-Horizon Problem: Stationary Data

      9.4.4.1 Tbe Model and tbe Solution
      Suppose the horizon Tis infiuite. Assume that the problem data (the costs and the de­
      mauds) are stationary in time. So, c(t) ~ c. CCt, y) ~ C(y). etc., and the d(t) all have the
      same distribution. Let d denote a generic demand random variable. (These assumptions
      make sense only when the time periods are of equal length.)
           Let us peer ahead to the solution. It turns out to be marvelously simple: Define
                                                c+   = (I--y)c
                                             C+(y)   = -ycE[d] + c+y + CCy)
      Let s* be the smallest value of y minimizing C + (Y), that is, s* solves

                                               o      c+ + h
                                              Fd(y) = b+h­   (9.4.11)


      Assume that the cost ratio lies strictly between 0 and 1, so s* is finite. Thus, s* is the
      (stationary) myopic base-stock level.
      THEOREM 9.4.3. The statiouary base-stock policy with base-stock level s* is optimal.
      The myopic policy is optimal!
            Because s* remains constant over time, we can describe the policy as a demand­
      replacement nile: Assume that Xo oS 0'*. The policy sets y (0) ~ 0'*, sox(l) oS so, so y(l) =
      s*, and so on. Each yet) = s*, so x(t + I) = s* - d(t), so z(t + 1) = dU). Thus, each order
      just replaces the prior period's demand. (If Xo > s*. wait until demand depletes the inven­
      tory so that x(1) oS so; from then on the demand-replacement rule takes effect.) This is the
      way we interpreted a base-stock policy in earlier chapters. (When s*(t) changes over time,
      of course, this interpretation breaks down; a time-varying base-stock policy is not a
      demand-replacement rule.)
            It is no harder to solve the infinite-horizon problem than the single-period problem;
      equation (9.4.11) is identical to (9.4.2). When -y = I (the average-cost case), the cost ra­
      tio in (9.4.11) becomes h/(b + h) = I - w,just as in (6.5.3). (As in the continuous-time
      model, the optimal policy does not reflect the order-cost rate c, because under any rea­
      sonable policy the average order cost is tbe constant cE[ d].)
            The optimal cost is easy to compute also: The optimal average cost (for the case
      -y = 1) is given by
                                      v* ~ C+(0'*)    = cE[d] +      C(s*)

      For the discounted-cost case (-y < I), let V*(x) be the optimal discounted expected cost
      over the infinite horizon, and V+*(x) ~ V*(x) + (x. Then,
                                               C+ (s*)

                                       V+*(x) ~-­                x   S s*

                                                     I - -y


      The remaining values take a bit more work. It is necessary to solve the functional equation
                             V+(x)   = C+(x) + -yE[V+(x        - d)]         x> s*

l) allhave the
, assumptions       9.4.4.2 Proof
                    Before justifying this result, we need to formulate the problem precisely. We distinguish
Ie: Derme           between the two cases 'I < I and 'I = 1. When 'I < I there is some hope that the total
                    expected cost is finite over an infinite horizon, while if'Y = 1 the total cost is certainly
                    infinite under every policy, so we need a different criterion. (This is true, not just of in­
                    ventory models, but of dynamic programs in generaL)
                         In the discounted-eo5t case ('I < I) suppose we ehoose a particular policy, say 7T,
                    an ordering rule for each of an infinite number of periods. Let
                          V(XI7T) ~ total expected discounted cost using policy 7T, starting withxo = x
         (9.4.111

                    The expectation is over all possible demand sequences. We want to choose a policy 'TT*
r*isoptimaL         that minimizes V(XI7T) for all x. Let V*(x) denote the optimal cost.
                         We have negleeted some fine points in this formulation: Each sample path of the
                    demand process contributes an infinite series to (9.4.12), and it is fair to ask whether
ISa demand­         sueh series converge finitely. One can show that, for any reasonable policy 1i', almost all
s*.soy(l)=
                    the series do converge finitely (i.e., with probability 1). Moreover, the expectation is well

bnuous-time              Again, we have neglected eertain technical issues. Everything works out satisfacto­
Ide.- any rea-      rily for our problem. For other dynamic programs, however, these issues require more
                    care. Indeed, the limit in (9.4.13) need not exist, and it is common to reformulate the cri­
Ifor the case       terion as
                       V(XI7T) = lim SUPT~ro (~)E[~;':-J {e(y(t) - x(l))              +   C(y(t») - cx(T) I x(O)      ~ x]
                    For our problem, this objective is equivalent to (9.4.13).
                         On the other hand, for reasonable problems (like ours) and reasonable policies,
q>ected cost
                    V(XI7T) is the same number for all x. In the long run, the effect of initial conditions dis­
                    appears. So, we can denote the cost of policy 7T by V(7T) and the optimal cost by v'.
                         Now that we have formulated the model, let us verify the solution outlined above.
                    PROOF OF THEOREM 9.4.3. We prove the result for 'I < I; the case 'I                        ~     I is virtu­
oal equation        ally identical. Substitute x(t + I) = y(l) - d(t) into (9.4.12) to obtain

      Now, for every t and every possible x(t), the base-stock policy with base-stock level s'
      sets yet) to minimize C+(y(t», subject to yet) '" x(t). (The argument is the same as in
      the single-period model.) Moreover, ifx(t) 0; s' and we continue to apply this policy, we
      shall have yet + I) = s',y(t + 2) ~ s', etcetera. On the other hand, ifx(t) > s', the pol­
      icy sets yet) as small as possible, to x(I). So, whatever value of d(t) happens to occur,
      x(t + I) will be as small as possible, and the feasible range for yet + I) as large as pos­
      sible. The same is true for subsequent times. In sum, this policy minimizes C+(y(t»for
      all t andfor every demand sequence. It certainly minimizes the expected discounted sum
      of these costs. and so is optimal.
          This argument is quite easy and ilhuninating. It exploits certain special characteris­
      tics of the model. Other dynamic programs, unfortunately, cannot be analyzed in this
      way, including the fixed-cost model ofthe next section. We now sketch (omitting certain
      details) an alternative proof ofTheorem 9.4.3, which illustrates the general approach re­
      quired by more complex models. Again, we focus on the case -y < I. (There is an argu­
      ment along these lines for the average-cost case, but it is more intricate.)
           This approach analyzes the sequence of finite-horizon models for increasing values
      of T. To identify a time point in this context, what matters is not its distance from time 0
      but rather its distance from the horizon. Accordingly, we utilize a different indexing
      scheme for time. Specifically, set

                                                     n   ~   T- I

      So, n refers to that point in time when there are n periods remaining in the problem. Since
      the data are stationary, V(n, .) ~ VeT - I, 'J, s'(n) ~ s'(T - t), etc., have the same val­
      ues for different T, provided that t is shifted accordingly to keep n constant. Equations
      (9.4.3) to (9.4.5) now become

                             V(O. x)   = -ex                                              (9.4.14)

                            H(n. y)    =   ey   + eey) + -yE[V(n - I,y - d)]              (9.4.l5)

                             V(n, x) = -ex       + min {H(n, y) : y '" xl                 (9.4.l6)

         There is another functional equation that plays a key role in the infinite-horizon dy­
      namic program:

                                  H(y)     ~    ey   + eey) + -yE[V(y -   <1)]            (9.4.17)

      The pair (9.4.17) and (9.4.18) is called the oplimality equation. This is just (9.4.15) and
      (9.4.16) with the time index n removed. That difference is important, however, for the
      same functions H and V appear on both sides; these are unknowns to be solved for. With­
      out further analysis, we do not know whether a solution exists, nor, if so, whether it is
      umque.
          We plan to apply (but not prove) a general theorem about dynamic programs with
      stationary data. Stated in our terms, the result is this:

      in t, and the demands d(t) be limited similarly.) Then, one can show that a base-stock po~'
      is optimal, and Theorem 9.4.2 continues to relate the myopic and optimal policies.
            In practice, it is useful to combine the finite- and infinite-horizon models, to avoid
      misleading horizon effects: It is often possible to specify the data with some confidence
      for a relatively short horizon T, but not for time points further into the future. However.
      the system is expected to continue operating well past T. Setting VeT, x) = -c(T)x may
      thus distort the results.
            Here is an alternative approach for the case 'Y < 1: Treat the data after T as station­
      ary, estimate them as well as possible, and solve an infinite horizon model with the data;
      specifically, compute the optimal cost V'(x). Then, set VeT, x) = V'(x), and solve the
      finite-horizon modeL
            This same idea can be used with all the more elaborate models below.


      9.4.6 Lost Sales
      The models above assume that stockouts are backlogged. Now, consider the lost-sales
      case. The lost-sales assumption changes the formulation in only minor ways, and the key
      results remain valid. (These results do not extend to a longer order leadtime, however, as
      explained in Section 9.6.5.1 below.)
           The net inventory x(t) is now just the inventory, so x(t) "" 0. The dynamics are
                          x(t   +   I) = [x(t)   + z(t)   - d(t)]+

                                      = [yet)    - d(t)]+        t ~ 0, ... , T - I

                                                                                            °
      Imagine that, if d(t) > yet), the lost sales d(t) - yet) occur andx(t + I) is set to just at
      time t + I. Reinterpret b(t + I) as the unit cost oflost sales. So, the one-period cost func­
      tion remains C(t, y) as defined earlier. (Usually, bet + 1) includes the unit sales price, so
      C includes revenue lost to shortages. This specification is consistent with the model of
      Section 9.4.5.2 below, which treats revenue explicitly.)
           Also, assume that bet + 1) + h(t + 1) "" '(c(t + 1). This condition is nearly always
      true in practice; the sales price normally exceeds the unit cost. [n theory, moreover, it
      should be true: Think of bet + I) as the unit cost charged by a special, emergency source,
      which delivers instantaneously at time t + 1, in time to satisfy those prior-period de­
      mands [yet) - d(t)]- that would be lost otllerwise. Given that possibility, why not ac­
      quire extra emergency stock, hold it in inventory at cost h(t + 1), and use it at the end of
      period t + I? That transaction is equivalent to a regular order, and if it is cheaper, i.e., if
      bet + I) + h(t + I) < '(c(t + I), tllen we should always use it instead of the regular sup­
      ply channel. In that case, we may as well replace e(t + I) by [bet + l)+h(t + 1)]/'(.
           The dynamic-programming formulation is almost identical to (9.4.3) to (9.4.5), but
      (9.4.4) now becomes
                       H(t,y) = c(t»)'     + C(t,)') + '(E[V{t + 1, [y -         d(tW}]
      It is convenient to work directly with the myopic formulation analogous to (9.4.6) to
      (9.4.8). Redefine
                        C+ (t, y) ~ e(t»)' - '(c(t    + I )E[[y -    d( t)]+]   + C(t, y)

                            We claim that the base-stock policy with parameters s*(t) is optimal. To demonstrate
                      this, we need to strengthen Theorem 9.4.1 slightly. Part (c) now says that the extended
ne lost-sales         function V+ (t, x) is convex and nondecreasing in x. Assume this for t + 1. Then, H(t, y)
,and the key          is convex, and V+(t, x) is convex for x 2:: 0, as before. Also, V+(t, x) is nondecreasing
~ however,   as       for x ;" 0, which implies that it is convex and nondecreasing for all x, completing the in­
                      duction. (The nondecreasing property is essential; without it, the extended function
IDes are              would lose its convexity, and the proof would break down.)
                            Setthe myopic base-stock level s + (t) to minimize C + (t, y). As before, this provides
                      a simple upper bound on s*(t).
                            In the infinite-horizon model with stationary data the myopic policy is optimal. (The

71)Yy·                The models above focus on operational costs; revenues are outside their scope. In many
(9.4.5), but          situations, however, the primary rationale for inventory is to support the exchange of
                      goods for money. Fortunately, it is possible to extend the models to include revenues ex­
                      plicitly. The overall objective now broadens from cost to profit.

           Consider the lost-sales case first. The nnrnber of units sold at the end of period t is
      precisely
                                 min (y(t), d(t)} ~ d(t) - [d(t) - y(t)]+
      Viewed from step (2) of time t, the expected revenue is given by R(t, yet)), where
                              R(t, y) = pet   + l){E[d(t)] - E[[d(t) - Jr]}
          The relevant costs are the same as those in the earlier models. We can combine them
      with R to set up a model to maximize profit. Let us equivalently minimize the negative
      ofprofit, i.e., cost minus revenue. (This is a peculiar objective, but it is perfectly valid,
      and it will allow us to use the methods developed earlier.) Define the one-period profit
      function pet, y) ~ R(t, y) - C(t, y). To formulate the model, we need only replace
      Cabove by -P ~ C - R.
           Observe thatR(t, y) is a concave function ofy (i.e., -R is convex). Therefore, -Plt, y)
      is convex in y (y,Ie actually need only - p+ ~ C+ - R to be convex, and this is true under
      the reasonable conditionp(t) + b(t) + h(t) 2> -yc(t).) The analysis of the original (cost­
      minimization) model above thus remains valid; in particular, a base-stockpolicy is optimal.
           Notice that subtracting R from C leaves the form of the function unchanged. There
      is a constant term -pet + I)E[d(t)], and the penalty-cost coefficient bet + 1) is incre­
      meuted by pet + 1). This makes sense: Wben a sale is lost, we lose the corresponding
      revenue.
          In the stationary infinite-horizon case, s* satisfies

                                        F~(y) ~       (c+ + h)
                                                   (p+b+h--yc)
           Now, suppose nnfilled demands are backlogged. This case is harder, conceptually
      as well as technically. Suppose the price p(t) changes over time. If a demand occurs in
      period t - 2, but can only be filled later, at the end of period t - I, which price applies,
      pet - I) or p(t)? IfpU) > p(t - I), it seems unfair to charge the higher price. Fair or not,
      if we do charge p(t), why should customers be willing to wait?
           Nevertheless, assume for simplicity that indeed pet) is the price for all demands and
      backorders filled at time t, even those due to earlier demands. To make this assumption
      more palatable, and to facilitate the analysis, we restrict the price parameters, requiring that
                                    pet) - '(pet   + I) + bet) + h(t) 2> 0                    (9.4.19)

      This condition holds when pet) is constant or decreasing. It allows price increases, but
      only modest ones.
           Ifx(t) 2> 0, thenR(t, y) above still measures the expected revenue. Ifx(t) < 0, how­
      ever, we can also collect revenue by filling outstanding backorders. Imagine that demand
      occurs before the order arrives. So, we could sell as many as d(t) - x(t) units. Of these,
      we cannot fill more than Z(I) ~ Ylt) - x(t). Thus, the number of units sold when
      x(t) < 0 is
                     min {yet) - x(t), d(t) - x(t)} = d(t) - [d(t) - y(t)]+ - x(t)
      In general, for any x(t), the nmnber of 'mits sold is

          This entire discussion presumes that the prices p(l) are given constants. Problem 9.8
      explores a scenario where they are decision variables. (The problem explores just that
      one scenario, however. The general case is difficult.)

      9.4.8 Imperfect Quality
      9.4.8.1 Discussion
      Next, suppose that the supply system sometimes produces defective lUlits. If we order
      z(l) = Z at time I, the amount of usable goods we actually receive is S(t, z), a random
      variable called the yield. Equivalently, S(t, z) = z - ~(t. z), where ~(I, z) is the quantity
      of defecis. We observe the yield when the order arrives. At that instant we pay for the
      nondefective goods, and only those (as in case I of Section 3.6.2), so the actual order
      cost is c(t)S(I, z). The yield in each period is independent of all other events, i.e., the de­
      mands and the other periods' yields. The yield distribution can depend on time, but for
      notational simplicity assume it does not; we write S ~ S(z) and ~ ~ ~(z).
           Before delving into details, let us try to see intuitively what is going on: The dy­
      namic.s become
                                    X(I + I) ~ x(l) + S(z(I)) - d(t)                          (9.4.20)

      There are Iwo sources of uncertainty about x(t + I), the demand and the yield.
            What happens if we follow a base-stock policy? Consider a stationary setting for sim­
      plicity, with base-stock level s(l) ~ s, starting with x(O) :0; s. We order z(O) = s - x(O), so
      x(I) = s - [~(z(O)) + d(O)]. The defects make x(l) less than it would be otherwise. We do
      make up the difference at time I, orderingz(J) = s - x(l) ~ ~[z(O)] + d(O). But then x(2)
      = s - [~(z(l)) + d( I)], which is likely to be even smaller, because of the large z(l). This
      pattern continues: At each time I, z(l) replaces period (I - I)'s defects as well as demand.
      Even so, period I'S defects lead to a lower x(1 + I) than we would otherwise expect. Know­
      ing this, we most likely want to choose s higher than in the no-defect model.
           How might we do better? Instead of ordering just to correct for past defects, we
      might aim to anticipate defects in the current period.
           Consider the deterministic-yield case: There is a constant yield rate 1;, or a constant
      defecI rale 8, as in Section 3.6. The aetual yield S(z) is]ust the function (;z. The solution
      here is straightforward: Solve the no-defect model. A base-stock policy is optimal there;
      the optimal order size is [s* - X(I)]+. In the real system, inflale this quantity to antici­
      pate defects; that is, set z(l) ~ 0 if x(l) '" s* and z(t) ~ [s* - x(1)]/(; otherwise, so that
      x(l) + S(z(l)) ~ max {s*, x(I)}. The actual net inventories x(l) and the costs are precisely
      the same as in the no-defect model. (This idea works even with nonstationary data.)
           With random yields, of course, we can no longer anticipate perfectly. If we set
      z(l) > 0 so that x(t) + z(l) > s*, and the yield turns out higher than expected, we may find
      x(t + 1) > s*. This is an unwelcome outcome. It is not clear just how to anticipate
      properly.
           Here is the plan: First, we consider a special case. A dynamic-programming analy­
      sis shows that, indeed, we should modify the base-stock rule to anticipate defects: We
      can decide when to order by comparing x(l) to a certain base-stock level s*(t). When x(l)
      < s*(I), the actual amount to order is more than s*(I) - x(I). Unfortunately, the analysis
      cannot tell us just how much more; that requires a detailed calculation in each period.

                     proximate steady-state performance evaluation and, on the basis of that analysis, select
                     the best such policy.

      property ensures that C(t, x, z) and C+ (t, X. z) are jointly convex in (x, z) for each t.
          Let us proceed directly to the myopic formulation of the dynamic program:
                      V+(1; x) = 0
                     H(f. x. z)   =   C+(t, x, z)      + 'YE[f··+(t +       1, x   + 8(z)     - d(t»]
                       V+(f. x)   =   min {H(f, x, z) : =""         OJ
      Notice that H can be written as H(t, x, z)             =   + 8(z»], where
                                                                 E[H(t, x

           In the one-period model we ean drop the time index. The problem is to choose
      z"" 0 to minimize H(x, z) ~ C+(x, z), where C+(x, z) = E[ C+(x + 8(z»]. What does
      the optimal policy look like? Let s' mininrize C+ (y). so s' is the optimal base-stock
      level for the no-defects problem. Let z' = z'(x) denote the true optimal order size, and
      y'(x) ~ x + z'(x).

      So, z(l) ~ [U(I)/[3]+, and the dynamics (9.4.20) can be expressed as

                                 u(1    +      I) = U(I) -   S([      UiT)     + d(l)

      Our goal is to approximate thc mean and variance of U(f) in equilibrium. The steady-state
      random variable u = s -- x plays the same role as d in a no-defects model, and we shall
      approximate it with a normal distribution. Given these approximations, we can set sand
      [3 optimally.
           We continue to assume proportional yield. (In fact, more general yield models can
      be analyzed similarly; see Problem 9.9.) For simplicity, set ~l ~ E[~] and ~2 = V[~].

           The key step in the approximation is to ignore the possibility ofu(l) < 0, setting z(l)

      = u(I)/[3. So, the dynamics become linear:

                                     u(1    + I) ~      u(r) - W)U(I)        + d(t)

                                E[U(I   +      I)] =   C~ ~l )E[U(I)] + E[d(I)]

           Now, rom to V[u]: Applying the conditional-variance formula, as in Section C.6.3,

            V[U(I) -   W~(t)]   = V{E[(I -             ~g))U(I)   I   u(lm   + E{V[(I - ~g))u(l) , u(lm

                               It is not hard to verify that the value of 13 that minimizes this function is

                                                                    13*   =   ~i + ~2         E[e]

                                    Notice, 13* < I, so the resulting policy is a linear-inflation rule. In the deterministic­
                               yield case 13* ~ ~I ~ ~, the correct value. Otherwise. 13* > ~I' The best inflation factor
                               is larger than in the deterministic case. We do anticipate defects, but only somewhat.
                               Oddly, when the yield is highly variable, 13* is near 1, so the rule comes close to a base­
                               stock policy.
                                    Substituting 13* into E[u] and V[u], we get

                               v + <Tz* as usual. The optimal cost C+ (s*) is proportional to <T = V[ u]. When the yield
                               is really random (~2 > 0), <T is larger than the original <T = YV[d]. Yield uncertainty
                               hurts performance. That uncertainty is expressed here by the ratio ~2/~i = V[~]/E2[~],
                               the squared coefficient of variation of~.
                                     As noted at the beginning, this is an approximate analysis. Still, the linear-inflation
                               rule using 13* seems to work fairly well. The even simpler rule with 13 = E[~] works well
                               also.

                               This section allows positive fixed costs k(t). Otherwise, the model is the same as before.
                               it turns out that an (r. s) policy is optimal at each time point. (We saw this type ofpolicy
                               in Section 6.6.)

          Again, we proceed in three major steps, depending on the horizon length, and then
      discuss extensions.


      9.5,] The Single-Period Problem
      Again, suppress the time index t. So, the fixed cost becomes k. The formulation is par­
      allel to that of Section 9.4.1. Defining the function H as before, we now need to solve
                                     Minimize            k8(y - x)      + H(y)
                                     subject to          y;:::'x                               (9.5.1)
      Let s* minimize H
             What is the optimal policy? Certainly, it is still best not to order when x ;:,: s*. How­
      ever, we may prefer not to order even when x < s*, to avoid the fixed order cost. If we
      do not order, the cost above is just H(x). [fwe do order, clearly, we want to set y = so,
      so the cost becomes k + H(s*). To decide between these two alternatives, then, we must
      compare the two numbers H(x) and k + H(s*).
             Recall that H is convex, so H(x) is decreasing for x < so. Let r* be that value of
      x :::; s· such that
                                              H(x)   ~   H(s*)     +k                          (9.5.2)
      Thus, H(x) ;:,: H(s*) + k for all x :5 r*, so it is less costly to order. And, for x > r* (but
      x :5 SO), H(x) < H(s*) + k, so it is optimal not to order. To conclude, the optimalpolicy
      is all (r, s) policy. The optimal parameters are the reorder point r* and the target stock
      level s*.
           Letting Vex) denote the optimal cost, we have Vex) = V+(x) - cx, where now

                                   V+(x) =
                                                  IH(s*) + k            x:5 r*
                                                                                               (9.5.3)

      See Figures 9.5.1 and 9.5.2.
           These functions are not convex. This does not affect the solution above, of course.
      Thinking ahead to the multiperiod problem, however, it is clear that we are going to have
      difficulties. In the linear-order-cost model the convexity of V was essential to the analy­
      sis. To prepare for later developments, then, we now reanalyze the single-period prob­
      lem. As we shall see, the results above remain valid under a weaker condition on H than
      convexity. This property, called k-convexity, is preserved by V. It will playa central role
      in the subsequent analysis.

          Let us try to understand this property intuitively: Iffis actually convex, then (9.5.4)
      holds for m = 0; O-convexity is equivalent to convexity itself. Also, the condition becomes
      weaker as m grows; that is, if/is 1n,-convex and m2 > m lo then/is also mrconvex. The
      expression on the left of (9.5.4) or (9.5.4') can be viewed as a linear approximation of
      f(x + ~) for fixed x. When m ~ 0 andfis convex, we recover the familiar fact that the lin­
      ear approximation underestimates the true valuef(x + ~). When m > 0, the approximation
      may overestimatef(x + ~), but the envr is bounded above by m. Figure 9.5.3 illustrates
      this property. The dotted line is the linear approximation.
           We state some additional facts in the following lemma; the proofis left to Problem 9.11.
      LEMMA 9.5.1.
      (a)	 Iff(x) is m-convex, then so is the shifted functionf(x + '1'), for any fixed 'I' (posi­
           tive or negative).
      (b)	 If.ft is ml-convex,j2 is m2-convex, and at and 02 are positive numbers, then the
           functionf= alii + f1.2h is m-convex, where m = aIm, + (l2m2­
      (c)	 IfJ is m-convex, andf(x) = E[J(x - d)], thenfis m-convex.
          Now, let us return to our problem. Since H above is convex, it is certainly k-convex.
      THEOREM 9.5.2. LetHbe any continuous, k-convex function in problem (9.5.1). The
      optimal policy is an (r, s) policy with parameters (r', s·), where s· is the smallesty min­
      imizing H(y), and r· is the largest x -<; s· satisfying (9.5.2).

      9.5.2 The Finite-Horizon Problem
      Next. consider a finite horizon T There is now a fixed order cost in each period. We as­
      sume that this cost is constant over time, i.e., k(l) = k> O. (See Problem 9.12 for the
      case of nonstationary k(1).) The formulation of the dynamic program, analogous to
      (9.4.3) to (9.4.5) above, is the following:

                        VeT, x)   ~   -e(Tlx	                                                           (9.5.5)
                        H(I, y) = e(l)y        + C(I, y) + 'YE[V(I + l,y - d(I))]                       (9.5.6)
                         V(I, x) = -e(llx        + min {ko(y -         x)   + H(I, y) : y   2-   x }    (9.5.7)

      Again, these equations describe a recursive scheme to compute an optimal policy. The
      form of the optimal policy is characterized in part (b) of the following theorem, the di­
      rect analogue ofTheorem 9.4.1:

      THEOREM 9.5.5. For all I,
      (a)	 H(I, y) is a continuous, k-convex function ofy.
      (b)	 The optimal policy for point I is an (r, s) policy; the target stock level s*(I) is the
           smallest value ofy minimizing H(I, y), and the reorder point r*(t) is the largest value
           of x <; s«I) satisfying

                                                H(t, x) = k   + H(t,   s«t))

      (c)	 V(I, x) is a continuous, k-convex function ofx.

      PROOF. The proofis parallel to that ofTheorem 9.4.1: Use induction on I, starting with
      1=  T - 1 and working backward. Assuming that V(I + I,x) is k-convex, Lemma 9.5.I(e)
      implies that EV[(I + I,y - d(I))] is too, hence so is H(I, y). For parts (b) and (e), use the
      results for the one-period model.
           Next, we derive relatively simple bounds on the optimal policy variables, analogous
      to the myopic policy of Section 9.4. We shall work with a transformed recursion, analo­
      gous to (9.4.6) to (9.4.8):

                             V+(T, x) = 0	                                                              (9.5.8)

                              H(I, y) ~ C+CI, y)          + 'YE[V+CI +         I, y - d(I))]            (9.5.9)

                             V+(I, x)      =   min {ko(y - x)      + H(I, y): y       2-   x}          (9.5.10)

      Again, let s + (I) denote the myopic base-stock level, the smallest value of y that globally
      minimizes C+ (I, y). Also, set s ++ (I) to the value ofy > s +(I) that solves

                                           c+(t, y)   =   C+(t, 5+(1)) + 'Yk

      and r + (I) to the value of y   <;   s + (I) that solves

                                      C+(I,y) = C+(t,S+(I)) + (1- 'Y)k

           (9.5.61

                                          [H(I, Y   + ~) -   H(I, y)] - [C+(t, Y   + ~) -   C+(t, y)]   2:   -~k      (9.5.11)

                         Now, fory    > s++(t), we have

"'" s*( t) is the

                     Consequently, y cannot minimize H, and we conclude that s*(t) :5 s ++(t).

                     EXAMPLE 9.5.A

                     As in Example 9.4.A, we consider four systems with 'Y = 1, h(t) = 1, and bet) = 9. The d(t) have
                     either Poisson or geometric distributions. In every case k = 5.
                          Figure 9.5.4 shows the optimal policy for a pair of models with stationary e(t). The E[d(t)]
                     change, but not too much; they oscillate between 20 and 40. Observe, in both the Poisson- and
                     geometrie-demand models, the difference q"'(t) = s"'(t) - r"'(t) remains nearly eonstant over t. In
402   Foundations ofInventory Management


      the Poisson-demand case. moreover, the changes in r*(t) are nearly parallel to the movements of
      E[d(t)]. This behavior is consistent with the heuristic proposed in Seetion 9.2. In the geometric­
      demand case too, r*(t) changes in the same direction as E[d(t)], but the changes are more pro­
      nounced; indeed, r*(t) is nearly proportional to E[d(l)]. (Here, the standard deviation of d(t) is no
      longer nearly constant; instead, it is close to E[d(t)].
           Next, we examine two systems with E[d(l)] fixed at 30 but changing e(t), as in Figure 9.4.3.
      The results are displayed in Figure 9.5.5. Both r*(t) and s*(t) anticipate changes in e(t), much like
      the optimal base-stock level in the linear-cost case. But r*(t) changes somewhat less than s*(t), so
      the difference q*(t) = s*(t) - r*(t) grows and shrinks considerably as the data change, especially
      in the geometric-demand case. ill contrast to demand changes, cost changes seem to have strong
      effects on all the policy variables.

           Myopic-like heuristics for the stationary-cost, nonstationary-demand case have
      been developed by Askin [1981] and Bollapragada and Morton [1994a]. Numerical tests
      indicate that they perform well; their costs are only a few percent above optimal.


      9.5.3 The Infinite-Horizon Problem
      Now, suppose the horizon T is infinite and the data are stationary. The analogue ofThe­
      orem 9.4.3 turns out to be true: A stationary (7, s) policy is optimal, both for -y < 1 and
      -y   =   1.

                          It is quite difficult to prove this fact, however. Nothing like the simple, direct proof
                     of Theorem 9.4.3 works here.
                          The alternative approach, using Theorem 9.4.4, can be adapted to this modeL The
                     argument is essentially the same as that of Section 9.4.3. Certain details, however, are
                     more problematic here. For instance, it is not generally true that the optimal policy vari­
                     ables r*(n) and s*(n) are constant, as in Lemma 9.4.5(b), nor even monotonic. However,
                     they are bounded, so the sequence {[r*(n), s*(n)]} has a limit point. This, it turns out, is
                     enough. Any such limit point describes an optimal policy.
                          To compute an optimal (r*, s*), requires an algorithm. The situation is essentially
                     the same as in the continuous-time setting: In the special case where the demand d is
                     either 0 or I, an (r, s) policy reduces to an (r, q) policy. To determine the best such pol­
                     icy, use Algorithm Optimize_rq of Section 6.5.4, with minor adjustments to account
                     for discrete time. Otherwise, use the similar method mentioned in Section 6.6, simi­
                     larly adjusted.
                          Alternatively, employ one ofthe algorithms for general dynamic programs. The sim­
                     plest one, conceptually, is called successive approximations: Perform the finite-horizon
                     recursion (9.4.14) to (9.4.16) (modified to include the fixed cost k, of course) for in­
                     creasingly large n. until an appropriate termination condition is met. The temlinal pol­
                     icy [r*(n), s*(n)] estimates (r*, SO).
                          The upper bounds of Theorem 9.5.6 now become stationary; denote them by s ++
                     and r+. Thus,s*(n)::; s++ andr*(n)::; r+ foralln, andsos*::; s++ andr*::; r+. These
                     bounds directly reflect the data of the problem, as discussed above.

               Because it is hard to compute the optimal policy, researchers have investigated
          workable approximations. Here is a good one, called the power approximation: Assume
          "y = I, and let v ~ E[d] and c? ~ V[d]. Set

                                 q   ~   1.30vo494(k/b)o.506[1 +(<Tlv)2]O.116

                                  s=r+q

          These formulas were obtained by solving a wide range of models, choosing a plausible
          functional form, and fitting the parameters with regression analysis. (The approximation
          works well provided qlv is not too small, say above 1.5. Otherwise, use the following re­
          vision: Compute the optimal base-stock level, s +. If s + < s, then replace s by s + and
          rby s+ - q.)
               Notice that the expression for q closely resembles the EOQ formula. The initial con­
          stant 1.30 is not far from {i, and the exponents of v and klh are close to X. The last term
          is an inflation factor to account for demand variance. In broad terms, therefore, the for­
          mula is consistent with the bounds and numerical example of Section 6.5.3. This re­
          semblance is remarkable, for the context there differs in several ways (e.g., continuous
          time). In the formula for r, the coefficient of 11 is nearly 1; the reorder point moves in tan­
          dem with the mean demand.


          9.5.4 Extensions
          What happens if we extend the model as in Sections 9.4.6 to 9.4.8?
               In the lost-sales case it is still true that an (r, s) policy is optimal. The r*(t) and s*(t)
          should be non-negative, of course, and we impose that as a constraint. In the one-period
          problem, for example, it is always true that s* 2: 0, but ifno x 2: 0 satisfies (9.5.2), set
          r* = O.
               With the profit objective of Section 9.4.7, everything works fine, as above.
               For the imperfect-qnality model of Section 9.4.8 we do not know what the optimal
          policy looks like; as yet there are no results comparable to Theorem 9.4.8.
               An analogue of the linear-inflation heuristic seems to work well for the stationary
          infinite-horizon model: Choose (r, s) and a constant [3 somehow. Then, if x .::::; r, order
          z ~ (s - x)ll3. We do not know how to extend the equilibrium analysis of Section 9.4.8.3
          to help select the parameters. It seems quite effective, however, simply to treat the yield as
          deterministic. That is, choose the optimal (r *, s *) in the no-defects model, and 13 = E[~].


9.6 Leadtimes
          9.6.1 Constallt Leadtime
          Suppose there is a constant, positive-integer leadtime 1. An order placed at t arrives by
          the end of period t + L - 1, in time to be counted in the net inventory at time t + L. As
                    Chapter 9    Time-Varying, Stochastic Demand: Policy Optimization                         405

alion: Assume       Al/ the qualitative resuIts of the last two sections remain valid.
                          In these terms the original model has leadtimeL ~ 1. As mentioned in Section 9.3.1,
                    some writers define "Ieadtime" a bit differently, so that the original model's leadtime is
                    0, and the leadtime here is L - I. This is a difference in labeling, not substance.
                          We slightly alter the timing conventions of Section 9.3: The cost ('(t, ') now occurs
                    precisely at time t, not before. Also, assume that we pay the order cost.. not when we
                    place an order, but rather when we receive it, i.e., time L later. So, the effective order cost
                    is y-[k(I)8(z(t» + C(t)Z(I)]. (These changes make the results come out a bit neater. They
                    matter, of course, only when"y < 1. In the original model with L ~ I the only effect is
ng a plausible
                    to multiply every cost factor by"y, so the solution remains unchanged.) By the way, pur­

                          In general, at time t, the current order Z(I) directly affects the net inventory at time
                    t + L. and no later order does so. It makes sense, then, to reassign the corresponding in­
                    ventory-backorder cost to point t. (This is an intuitive rationale; Section 9.6.2 presents a
                    rigorous one.)
                          To implement this new accounting scheme, redefine the state and control variables:

                    count them correctly at time t, therefore, we discount by the factor        -I.)

          For finite T this approach makes sense for t "" T - L, but what about times near the

      horizon? For simplicity, imagine that the horizon extends to time T + L - I; demands

      continue to occur and inventory-backorder costs continue to accrue until then. So, the
      same approach works for all t < T Again, the last order is placed at time T - I, and the

      inventory-backorder cost assigned to T - I is the actual cost at time T + L - 1. Also,

      for simplicity, assume there is no salvage value at time T + L.
            Let us formulate the dynamic program as before: Now, Vet, x) means the optimal

       cost under the revised accounting scheme, excluding the holding-penalty costs before

      time t + L, starting at time t with inventory position x. With the new definitions of Vand

       C. ti,e functional equations (9.4.3) to (9.4.5) or (9.5.5) to (9.5.7) remain valid as stated,

      except that all order-cost factors are multiplied by -yL

             We now have a model o{precisely the sameform as the original. The symbols have

      new meanings, but that is the only difference. The new C(t, y) is still convex iny. Thus,

      the main results of Section 9.4 and Section 9.5 still hold: In the linear-order-eost case,

      a base-stock policy is optimal; with afixed order cost, an (r, s) policy is optimal. The

      myopic policy for the linear-cost model optimizes the function C+(t, y), constructed

      from C as before, and Theorem 9.4.2 remains valid.

            Of course, the actual policies reflect the new data. The one-period cost C(t, y) now
      involves an expectation over demand in L periods, not just one. For instance, in the
      linear-order-cost model, s + (t) solves an equation like (9.4.10), but the ccdf of the lead­

      time demand D[t, t + L) plays the role of F~(y). Thus, the myopic policy is the discrete­

      time analogue ofthe heuristic approach of Section 9.2.2. For the reasons given there and

      in Section 9.4, the myopic policy is usually close to optimal.

            In the infinite-horizon problem with stationary data and k = 0, the myopic policy is
      optimal. and s* solves

                                                      (e+ + h)
                                             FJ,(y) = (b + h)

      as in (9.4.13), where D = D[O, L). Interestingly, only the left-hand side depends on L,
      not the cost ratio. When 'Y = 1, the cost ratio again becomes 1 - w. The solution here is
      essentially the same as that of equation (6.5.3).
           The optimal cost retains the same form as before: For 'Y = 1         J

      9.6.3 Other Supply Systems

      9.6.3.1 Exogenous, Sequential Systems

      Now, suppose the leadtime is a random variable. That is, an order placed at time twill

      arrive at some future time t + L(t), but L(t) changes randomly over t. We allow L(t) = 0;

      in this case z(t) arrives immediately, and is eounted in time t's net inventory x(t). Assume

      that the L(t) arise from a discrete-time version of the exogenous, sequential supply sys­

      tem of Section 7.4. That is, t + L(t) -5 (t + I) + L(t + I), so orders never cross in time.

      Also, we can do nothing to influence the L(t), and they are independent of the demands.

      Finally, the L(t) are stationary; each has the same (marginal) distribution as a generic

      leadtime variable L.

           Assume too that at each time t we have no information to help us predict L(t). That
      is, even conditional on what we know at t, L(t) has the same distribution as L. This can
      mean one of two things: Either L(t) is independent of all past events, so there really is no
      such information; or, while such information could be extracted in principle, we cannot
      obtain or use it. (In case you are wondering, there are systems where L(t) is independent
      of the past. Here is one: There is a sequence ofi.i.d. non-negative-integer random vari­
      ables A(t). At each time t, all orders that have been outstanding for time A(t) or more ar­
      rive immediately; that is, of the orders still outstanding, we receive those placed at
      t - A(t) or earlier. Thus, L(t) ~ min {u '" t: A(u) -5 u - t}. The constant-leadtime model
      is the special case where all A(t) = L.)
           Let us adaptthe cost-accounting scheme above to this stochastic setting: If we knew
      that L(t) ~ I, it would make sense to assign to time t the holding-penalty cost at time
      t + I, by the argument for the constant-Ieadtime case. So, we assign afraction ofthis cost

-~                    here is intuitive. The idea can be supported rigorously, but we shall not do so.)
                            The actual cost at each fixed time u is distributed among earlier times u - 1with these
                      same weights. Its cost is left unassigned with probability Pr {L > u}. This is exactly the
                      probability that the order at time 0 arrives after u. Thus, this scheme, like the original one,
                      omits those costs we cannot i.t.fluence. As for tenninal effects, assume that demands con­

                           We still pay for orders on receipt, so the effective order cost is E[·y'][k(t)o(z(t)) +
                      c(t)z(t)]. The expected inventory-backorder cost at time tnow becomes C(t, yet)), where

                      The expectation is over L as well as the demands. This function qt, y) is convex in y, for
                      it is a positive-weighted average of convex functions. With this new C. the dynamic­
                      programming fonnulation is precisely the same as before. So, again, all the previous re­

            There is a good approximation, however: Assume "y = I. Let u(t) = s - x(t), and let
      u be the corresponding steady-state random variable. This quantity plays the same role as
      D in the unlimited-capacity model, namely, C(y) = E[C(y - u)], and s* solves F~(y) =
       I - w. (In other words, u(t) is the occupancy ofa related discrete-time queue.) The tail of
      u, it turns out, is approximately exponential. That is, there are certain constants K and e,
      such that F~(y) = Ke -."1' for large y. (There are tractable numerical methods to estimate
      these constants; see Glasserman [1997].) Consequently,
                               s* = O[ln (K) - In (I - w)]
                                            E[u]
                            C(s*) = Oh[(l - -0-)    + In (K)   - In (I - w)]

      This approximation is very accurate when w is near 1. This is the discrete-time analogue
      of the exponential approximation of Section 7.3.11.

      9.6.3.3 Independent Leadtimes
      What about independent leadtimes, as in Section 7.2? There is no general optimality the­
      ory for such systems, to our knowledge. Such a theory would require a detailed scenario
      describing when we observe the leadtimes, or more generally how we obtain informa­
      tion about them. There are many alternatives. Each leadtime could be observed at the
      moment it begins, or ends. Or, partial information could be revealed during the leadtime.
      The optimal policy is probably different in each case, but complicated in every one.
           Section 7.2 made no such assumptions, but that is because base-stock and (1: q) poli­
      cies do not use leadtime information in any way. These are heuristic methods for what
      are, in fact, very complex problems.
           For simplicity, let us return to the constant-Ieadtime case.


      9.6.4 Relation to Continuous-Time Models
       Suppose for the moment that time is continuous. The data are stationary, demand is a
      compound-Poisson process, there are no scale economies, and the leadtime is a positive
      constant. It turns out that a base-stock policy is indeed optimal, under either the
      discounted- or average-cost criterion. There are several ways to demonstrate this fact. We
      shall sketch three of them, omitting formal proofs:
           First, the cost-reassignment scheme above is valid in continuous time. Thus, the
      function C(y) above measures the inventory-backorder cost rate with y(t) ~ IP(t) ~ y.
      Then, the simple proof ofTheorem 9.4.3 can be applied with only minor notational ad­
      justments.
           Second. we can discretize time. For any fixed period length we obtain a discrete­
      time model, and all the results above hold. (Of course, the discrete-time model's lead­
      time, one-period demand, and discount rate depend on the choice ofperiod length.) Now,
      take a sequence of such models with successively shorter periods. The continuous-time
      model is the limit as the period length goes to zero. The optimality result, it turns out, is
      preserved in the limit.
           Third, we can embed the process at demand epochs. This approach directly transforms
      the continuous-time problem into an equivalent discrete-time model. (The idea is essen­

00s to estimate           The second and third approaches can be applied to other models above and below.
                    (With rare exceptions, however, the first cannot.) With a fixed cost k. for instance, an (r. s)
                    policy is optimal. In the Poisson-demand case, of course, this reduces to an (r. q) policy.
                          In sum, the policies we chose to evaluate in Chapter 6 really are optimal, at least
                     for Poisson and compound-Poisson demand. Therefore, the optimization methods ofSec­
                     tion 6.5 find the best policy overall.

      This recursion looks much like (9.6.2). Unfortunately, because the dynamics and hence
      the one-period cost C are so complex, we cannot reduce the state to the single variable x.
           In principle, once again, the recursion prescribes a computational procedure to find
      the optimal policy. However, the state variable is now an L-vector. [t is a sad fact that, in
      general, dynamic programs with high-dimensional states are VelY hard, indeed virtually
      impossible, to solve. (This pomt is vividly expressed by the phrase, the curse ofdimen­
      sionality. If we discretize and truncate the state vector, using n values for each compo­
      nent, say, then the total number of states is n L . The computational effort required is at
      least proportional to this number, which grows exponentially in L.)
           Thus, in practice, there is no way to find the true optimal policy. Moreover, little is
      known about its structure; it is probably very complex and hard to implement. If we can't
      optimize, are there heuristic approaches that work well? Fortunately, the answer is yes.
      For simplicity, focus on the stationary, infinite-horizon model.
           The key idea is to adapt the myopic approach to this system. Let t = 0 indicate the
      current time, so (9.6.4) becomes

                        x(I +   I) =   [x (I) + 2L-1-1 -    d(l)t       o $/<L              (9.6.5)

      and the one-period cost becomes

                            C(x, z,z) ~ 'YLE[C(x(L -       I)   + z - deL - 1))]
      Define the function
                         c+(x, z, z) ~ 'YLc{(x + z) - 'YE[x(L)]) + C(x, z, z)
      The last term C is the (expected) holdiog-penalty cost. The first approximates the effect
      of z on current and future order costs. (The rationale for this approximation is subtle; we
      omit it.) So, C+ includes all the short-term costs ofthe current order. The myopic policy
      selects z to minimize C+. Numerical studies have found that this approach works quite
      well.
           The myopic policy is much harder to implement here than in the backlog case. At
      each time point we must minimize C+ anew. (In principle, we could detennine the best
      z for every possible (x, z) m advance, but that would be tedious.) Just to evaluate C+, we
      must use (9.6.5) recursively to compute the distributions of x(L - I) and thenx(L). Still,
      this is much easier than computing the true optimal policy.
           It is interesting and useful to explore the approach in detail: We can rewrite   err in
      the form
                CU, z,z)     = -I{c(X + z) + (h -     'Yc)E[x(L - I) + z - deL - I)]
                                + (b + h - 'Yc) E[[x(L - I) + z - deL - IWJJ
      Assuming {as in Section 9.4.6) b + h - "Ie 2: 0, this function is convex in z. So, once
      we have the distribution of x(L - I) - deL - I), the minimization over z is fairly rou­

                    demand-replacement rule. The same is true in a lost-sales system, except that lost sales
                    are not counted; the base-stock policy replaces filled demands. When the prior demand
                    is large. the myopic policy typically orders less than the base-stock policy. That demand

                    Section 7.3.4 with Poisson demand, a single processor, no scale economies, and lost
                    sales. Assume that we have direct control over the processor, as in Section 7.3.10.2, so

      we decide at each instant whether to tum it on or off. It turns out that a simple base-stock
      policy is optimal: For some s* keep the processor on when inventory is less than s* and
      off otherwise. The methods of Section 7.3.4 can thus be used to evaluate alternative poli~
      cies and to find the best.


      9.6.6 Profit Maximization
      Even with L > 1, the profit-maximization model, like that of Section 9.4.7, is equiva­
      lent to the corresponding cost-minimization model.
           In the lost-sales case, with z(t) ~ z, the number of units sold just before time t + L
      is now


                       ~ d(t   +L
                                 min(X(t+L-1)+z,d(t+L-I)}
                                  - I) - [d(t + L - 1) - x(t + L - I) - z]+
                                                                                                              9.7   Worl~

      so the expected discounted revenue is
         R(t,x, z,z) ~ '/Lp(I+L)E[d(t+L -1) - [d(t+L-I) -x(I+L - 1)                             -=tJ
                                                         x,
      Subtract this from C(I, X, z, z) to get - pet, z, z). This function has the same form as C.
      Thus, to acconnt for revenue, just replace C by -Pin the model above.
          In the backlog case, we cannot influence revenues at times t < L, so ignore them.
      The number of units sold at time I + L is
                       min (x(1 + L - I) + z, d(1 + L - III + [x(1 + L - IW
                           = d(1   +L    - 1) - [X(I     + LW +    [x(t   + L - IW
      Ignore the last term for I = 0, and for I > 0 reassign it to I + L - 1. Next, reassign all
      oftime I + L's revenue to I. The expected revenue assigned to I, then, is R(I, y(I», where
      now
            R(t, y) = '/Lp(1   + L)E[d(1 + L        - 1)] - ';p +(1   + L)E[[y   - D[I, I   + L)n
      From this point on, proceed as in Section 9.4.7. Provided the p(l) satisfy (9.4.19),
      - p+ (t, y) is again convex iny. So, the steucture of the optimal policy remains the same
      as before, a base-stock or an (r, s) policy, depending on the order-cost function.


      9.6.7 Imperfect Quality
      What happens to the stochastic-yield model of Section 9.4.8 when L              >     I? The state is
      now [x(I), Z(I)] and the dynamics (9.4.20) become

                                   X(I   +   I)   = x(l) + E[ZL-,(t)]   - d(l)
      As in the lost-sales model, the intricate dynamics make it impossible to reduce the state
      to a single variable. Thus, because of the curse of dimensionality, we cannot hope to
      solve the model exactly.
           Let us try to adapt the linear-inllation heuristic: First, we would like to aggregate the
      state variables into one, analogous to the inventory position. But this is problematic, be­
      cause the yields of outstanding orders are uncertain, as in Section 7.4.3.2. In the spirit of
                                                                                                                       ,,' 1,:':"'11',11,'1'1,111,,1   "II II   !!!!J!!*~

                              time passes, events which do affect future demands. Put another way, our information
                              about the future evolves over time. Expressed yet another way, there is some system
                              whose behavior drives demands.

      demand-driving factors that change systematically over time, such as the weather over
      several seasons.
           Also, many standard forecasting techniques embody a world-driven demand model,
      explicitly or implicitly. The most familiar techniques work in discrete time. For exam­
      ple, the popular exponential-smoothing method essentially views the world as scalar
      variable W( t), representing the current demand forecast itself or some simple transfor­
      mation of it, which evolves according to a Markov process. More elaborate techniques,
      designated by the acronym ARMA, model Wet) as a vector. See Section C.6.4 of Ap­
      pendix C.
           Here is a related model: Demand has a stationary distribution of some particular,
      known form, but with an unknown parameter. For example, we may know that demand
      has a Poisson distribution, but not its actual mean. Here, Wet) represents our current es­
      timate of the parameter (more precisely, a sufficient statistic for it). The dynamics ofW
      include some mechanism for updating the estimate (usually Bayes' rule) to incorporate
      each additional demand observation.
           As we shall see, the qualitative results of earlier sections remain valid. For instance,
      in the linear-order-cost case, a base-stock policy is optimal. However,just as the optimal
      base-stock level depends on t in the original model, so here it reflects all relevant infor­
      mation about the future, namely, the current world state 11-' as well as t.


      9,7.2 Formulation andAnalysis
      Assume that the leadtime is the positive-integer constant L. FoUowing Section 9.6, the
      one-period cost function is
                        qt,   W,   y) ~ ,/E[(;(t   + L, y   - D[t, t   + L))   I   W(I)   = w]
      Except in special cases, this function is hard to compute exactly. (The leadtime demand
      D[t, t + L) is a complicated random variable, as in Section 6.3; it includes the effects of
      future values of W, conditional on Wet) = w. Sometimes, depending on the form of
      (W, D), it is possible to estimate the moments of D[I, I + L), and to use them to approx­
      imate C. Problem 9.16 computes the moments for the exponential-smoothing model, and
      Section 9.7.3 below illustrates their uses.) For now, however, we are concerned more
      with the/arm of the one-period cost, and that remains simple. The fimction ql, w, y) is
      convex in y for each (t. w).
           Consider first the linear-order-cost case (k ~ 0) for a finite horizon T. Think through
      the dynamic-programming logic, applying the principle ofoptimality, to arrive at the fol­
      lowing formulation:

             H(I, w, y) ~ y-c(l)y     + ql, w. y) + -yE[V(1 + I, w',y -              d(I»   I W(I)   = w] (9.7.2)

      The expectation in (9.7.2) is over the demand d(t) Gndthe next state Wet + I) = w', both

                    In modeling the world-demand system (W, D), then, we confront the classic trade­

               off between accuracy and tractability. It is tempting to include everything we know about

               the drivers of demand in the world W. When we know a lot, however, the resulting model

               may be too complex to solve. We must use our best judgment and/or analytical skills to

                                                                                                                                V-l
               identify the really important factors and include only those.

                    Things do not become substantially simpler in the infinite-horizon model. The most

               direct approach is successive approximations. This method, mentioned earlier in Sec­ 

               tion 9.5.3, entails solving a sequence of finite-horizon models with increasingly long

               horizons.


               9.7.3 The Myopic Policy and CostApproximation
               Reconsider the finite-horizon model with linear order costs. Define
                           C+(I,   W,   y) ~ -f+le(t      +   I)E[d(I)IW(I) ~ w]        + -fe+(I)Y + C(I, w, y)
               and set the myopic base-stock level S +(I, w) to minimize C+(I, W, y). One can show as in

               Theorem 9.4.2(a) thats + (t, w) is an upper bound ons*(I, w). Analogues of the other parts

               of Theorem 9.4.2 can also be derived. See Problem 9.17. (The same idea works with

               world-dependent order costs e(l, w). The function C+ involves a cost factor e+(I, w)

               which is a bit more intricate than before; see Problem 9.18.)

                   Moreover, the myopic approach yields a relatively simple lower bound on the opti­ 

               mal cost. Reasoning as in Section 9.4.3, V+(O, w, x)'" V_CO, w), where

                                   V_CO, w) ~ X;~J'y'E[C+{I, W(I),s+(I, W(I»))                   I   W(O) ~ w]

               The expectation in term I is over [W(I) I W(O) ~ w]. So, to compute this lower bound, we

               must know and use the dynamics of W.

                    Once again, s +(t, w) reflects the problem data in a simple way. Assume the cost fac­

               tors are stationary. Estimate

                                                   V(I, w)    ~   E[D[t, I + L) W(I) =
                                                                                  I          w]

                                                  <T\I, w) ~ V[D[I,      I + L) I W(t) =     w]

               and approximate D[I, I + L) using a normal distribution. Letting z* solve 1l 0 (z) =
               (e+ + h)/(b + h), we obtain

               S +(1,   w) = v(l, w)    + <T(I,   w)z*

      C+(I, w, S+(I, w)) = 'l{'yeE[d(l) I W(I) = w]               + e+v(l, w) + <T(I,     w)(b       + h)<I>(z*))
              V_CO, w) = 'lX;~h'E['yed(l)                + e+v(l,    W(I»    + <T(I,   W(I))(b   + h)<I>(Z*)    I   W(O) ~ w]

                   In the exponential-smoothing model of Problem 9.16, the demand data are also sta­

              tionary. We have E[d(l) I W(I) = w] = aw + d for positive constants a and d, v(l, w) ~

              v(w) takes the form j3w + dL, a linear function ofw, and <T(I, w) = <T(w) is a constant

              cr_, independent of w. So, the expressions above simplify to

                                    s+(w) ~ j3w       + (dL + <T_z*)

           Consider a series system. We focus on a two-stage system (J = 2) for convenience, hut
           the results extend to any J Information and control are fully centralized.
                Assume (until Section 9.8.4) that the costs to send goods from the source to stage I
           and from stage 1 to stage 2 are both linear. Shipments sent to stage j arrive after a lead­
           time of L}' (In the terms of Chapter 8, we are ahhreviating L; by Lj .)
                As we shall see, an echelon base-stock policy is optimal. We saw this policy form
           in Section 8.3.


           9.8.1 Formulation
           The formulation extends that of Section 9.6.2. The following state variables describe the
           system:
                ij(t)    ~   (local) net inventory at stage j at time t
                =j1(t)   = shipment in transit to stage j   sent I periods ago, i.e., at time t - I, 1= 1,
                             ... ,Lj - 1
                zit)     ~   (zjl(f)),
           (Forj ~ I, ii(t) is just the local inventory, so ii(t) "" 0.) The decision variables are
               zit) = shipment sent to stage j at time t
           We call z;(t) a shipment, not an order. The distinction is not important for stage I, but it
           does matter for stage 2. Under centralized control there is no place for stage-2 orders that
           stage I cannot fill immediately. Only actual, feasible shipments count. Thus, we must
           constrain Z2(t) to ensure that we ship from stage I no more than what is available there.
           Specifically, the constraints are

      are not really necessary, but they make the fonnulation neater.)

      the sum over (xz. zz), as above. We have

      (We further constrain Zz = 0 for t:2: T + L r andz l = 0 for t:2: T. Actually, provided the
      cost rates are all positive, these choices are optimal.)
           Evidently, this is a very complex dynamic program with a large state space. Fortu­
      nately. it can be simplified radically. (The dreaded curse of dimensionality can be lifted
      sometimes!) We shall describe the solution and then prove that it really is optimal.

                         for the next stage.
                              Recall from Section 8.3 that, with stationary data, an echelon base-stock policy can
                         be implemented by a local control scheme. That equivalence rests on the fact that a (lo­
                         cal) base-stock policy replaces demands, so stage 2's orders provide stage 1 with com­
                         plete demand information. With time-varying data, however, this is no longer true. To
~namicpro-
                         implement the policy, each stage must have direct access to demand information.

          With an infinite horizon and stationary data, the myopic approach yields the opti­
      mal policy. (This can be proven by using Theorem 9.4.4.) Specifically, set c;= (I - '!)cj ,
      D, = D[O, L,), and D 2 = D[L" L I + L 2 ). Define
                                      C2 (Y) = '!iE[C2 (y - D 2 )]
                                      C?(y) ~ ,!c2E[d]      + c?y + C2(y)
      and let s! minimize C?(y) over y. Then, define
                                   1:?(y) = C?(min {s!,y)) - C?(s!)

                                      Cr(x) ~ h,x   + 1:?(x)
                                      C,(y) ~ -f'E[Cr(y - D I )]

                                      Cr(y) ~ ,!c,E[d]   + cry + C,(y)
      and let sf minimize Cr(y) overy. Apart from a few details, this is precisely the algorithm
      of Section 8.3.3.
           In the nonstationary model, the myopic policy in effect treats the current data as sta­
      tionary over an infinite horizon, as in Section 9.4. Consequently, the booods of Sec­
      tion 8.3.5, with minor adjustments to account for discrete time, can be used to describe
      the myopic policy.


      9.8.3 Proof
      We now argue rigorously that the policy determined by the recursions above is indeed
      optimal.
           Let us obtain an explicit expression for VeT + L"            " " " -).  Recall that, in (9.8.3),
      Z2 ~ 0 for I '" T + L" and ZI ~ 0 for I '" T. Also, hl(t)         ~   0 for I '" T + L I. Therefore,
      the expected cost at time I = T + L I is
                                VeT + L" X" Z" X2, Z2)      = C 2(T   + L" X2, Z2)
      where

                C2(1, X2> Z2) = Cg(l, X2)    + C~(t,   X2   + z2L, ,-I) + ... + ci,-I(I, X2)
            We simplifY (9.8.3) in three steps: (I) We apply the logic ofTheorem 9.6.1 to reduce
      the vector (X2> Z2) to the scalar X2' This step yields a dynamic program involving functions
      ofthe form V(t, x" z" x2)' (2) We show that these functions are separable, specifically, that
      V(t, x" z" x2) = VI (I, x" ZI) + V2(1, x 2) for some"'. The function V2 is the one defined
      above in (9.8.4). (3) We apply Theorem 9.6.1 once more to reduce t\(I, x" z,) to V,(x l ),
      where V, is the function defined in (9.8.5).
           Slep 1. Observe thatz2 (1) affects the stage-2 costs measured by C2 (-,·) only at time
      1+ L 2. So, we can reassign C 2(t + L 2, .) to time I. More precisely, define V(t, x" z" x2)
      for loST + L I by the recursion
       V(T + L1, Xl'   Zb X2)   = 0
       V(I, x" Z" x,) ~ min {c,(t)z,      + c2(t)(Y2   - x2)   + hl(t)x I + C 2(t, Y2)

      Combining the two cases, we can write the value of (9.8.8) as

      Moreover, the base-stock policy that solves (9.8.5) yields the optimal stage-I shipments.


      9.8.4 Extensions
      It should be clear that the same logic applies to longer series systems (J> 2): Work back­
      ward from J to 1. For each stage, reduce the state vector (as in step 3 above), and then
      separate the optimal cost (as in step 2). In conclusion, an echelon base-stock policy is
      optimal.
           Returning to the two-stage system, suppose there is an external fixed cost kj (t) =
      k I > 0, but the internal fixed cost k 2 (t) = O. The entire argument above remains valid as
      stated. In the dynamic programs involvingzj [(9.8.3), (9.8.5), and several others], the or­
      der cost includes a tenn kjO(ZI)' So, the optimal policy is a base-stock policy for stage
      2, computed using (9.8.4), and an echelon (r, s) policy for stage I, obtained by solving
      (9.8.5).
           A positive internal fixed cost k2 (t), however, destroys the argument. (Step 2 breaks
      down.) We can say little about the optimal policy here. An echelon (I; s) policy (as de­
      scribed in Section 8.3) is certainly a plausible heuristic.
           Now, consider an assembly system with linear shipment costs. In general, the opti­
      mal policy is quite complex. However, consider the infinite-horizon model with station­
      ary data. Provided the initial state satisfies an analogue of the long-run balance condi­
      tion (8.4.3), a balanced echelon base-stock policy is optimal. The best such policy,
      moreover, can be found by analyzing an equivalent series system.
           What about other starting states? If we do use that policy, sooner or later the system
      will achieve the balance condition, and from then on, the policy is optimal. That suffices
                           Chapter 9   Time- Varying, Stochastic Demand: Policy Optimization                      427

                           for the average-cost objective ("y ~ I); the best balanced echelon base-stock policy is
,1(. II)'                  truly optimal. For the discounted-cost case ("y < I), however, during that initial period
                           the policy is suboptimal; the true optimal policy also reaches the balance condition, and
e brooght 0lIl­            it does so at lower cost. But, the optimal policy is very intricate; it is hard to calculate
                           and hard to implement. It is reasonable, therefore, to use the balanced echelon base-stock
                           policy as a heuristic for all starting states.
                                This seems to be as far as one can go in the direction of structural complexity, at
. ·=I.L,-~lJl              least for now. For a distribution system, for example, it seems impossible to compute or
                           even to describe the true optimal policy. (The curse of dimensionality once again asserts
                           its power!) We must turn to approximations. The techniques of Section 8.6, for instance,
Ie is preriseIy
                           can be adapted to the discrete-time system to yield a heuristic policy and a lower bound
                           on the optimal cost.

      A.2.2 Optimality Conditions
      In general it is hard to find a global minimizer, or even a local one. Optimality conditions help
      us to find them, or at least to recognize them. The following is the classic first-order necessary
      condition:
      PROPOSITION A.2.t. Suppose fis continuously differentiable on the open set X Ifx* is a lo­
      cal minimizer, then

                                                        Vf(x*)       ~   0                                  (A2.1)
      This result suggests a method to find x*: Solve the system ofn equations in n unknowns (A.2.1).
      There is no guarantee, however, that a solution, if one exists, really solves the problem. To resolve
       that issue, we need the concept of convexity, introduced in the next section.
          Meanwhile, there are corresponding results for constrained optimization. We shall focus on the
      linear case: Suppose A is an m X n matrix with In < nand b an m-vector. XI} is an open sct in ffi:".

      (So, the actual set X is X o   n   {x : Ax   = b}.) Let A' denote the transpose of A.
      PROPOSITION A.2.2. Under these assumptions, ifx* is a local minimizer of/over X; then there
      exists an m-vector t*, such that

                                         Vf(x")    + A'~"   ~    0                                         (A2.3)
      If the rows of A (i.e., the columns of A') are linearly independent, moreover, t* is unique.

      The components oft* are called dual variables or Lagrange multipliers. Here, (A.2.2) and (A.2.3)
      comprise n + In equations in the n + m unknowns x and t.

      A.3 Convexity
      A.3.t Definitions and Properties

      The set X ~ ffi:" is convex if, for every pair of vectors Xl, x 2 E X and every scalar 'A E [0, 1],

      Thus, X is eonvex if it contains the whole line segment eonnecting x 1 and x 2 .
          Examples. In ffi:l an interval is convex; in ffi:2 a disk is convex; in ffi:3 a sphere is eonvex. In ffi:"
      the set ofsolutions to a system of linear inequalities, i.e., X = {x : Ax :s b}, is convex. (Such a set
      is called a convex polyhedron.) Also, the intersection of two convex sets is itself convex. If X is
      convex and y is a constant veetor, then the translated set X + Y = {x + y : x EX} is eonvex.

Ulmd(A231             Consequently,f(x) ~ L;p/':(X - d;) is convex [by part (b)].
                          Next, consider the general case. The function Jean be represented as the limit of a sequence
                      {Jm}, wherej~,(x) = E[C(x - d m )], and dm is a random variable of finite range. (The expectation

          In the one-dimensional case, the condition for convexity reduces to f"{x) ::2: 0, wbilef"(x) > 0
      implies strict convexity. In two dimensions, the convexity condition becomes c,z!(x)lax1 .2: 0,
      ;If(x)laX~::2: 0, and 1!V(x)1 ~ 0; ifall these inequalities are strict, thenfis strictly convex.
           One can similarly define convexity for a function/whose domain X is an interval of integers:
      fis convex if (A.3.1) holds whenever x itself is an integer. EquivalentlY,Jis convex if the first dif­
      ference a/(x) = [(x + 1) - f(x) is nondecreasmg inx. Also,fis convex if the second difference
       f1'f(x) ~ !1[!1f(x)] '" 0 for all x.fis s"iclly convex if these relations hold strictly. (This theory
      does not extend, however, to functions of several integer variables.)

      A.3.2 Implications
      Why do we care about convexity? The main reason is that it simplifies optimization. Assume
      that X is a convex set. The key results are the following:

      PROPOSITION A.3.5. Suppose/is convex onX Ifx* is a local minimizer ofJon X then x* is                      Notes
      also a global minimizer.

      PROPOSITION A.3.6. Suppose/is strictly convex onX Then,/has at most one, unique local
      (and hence global) minimizer x*.

      Thus, if we want to minimize!, and we know that/is convex, we need only search for a loci31 min­
      imum. And, ifJis strictly convex, we know that the optimal point is unique, provided one exists.
         Convexity also provides necessary and sufficient conditions for loei31 optimality itself. First,
      some definitions: A functionJis locally convex at x ifit is convex on some neighborhood ofx.

      PROPOSITION A.3.7. Ifx* is a local minimizer off, thenJis locally convex at x*.

      PROPOSITION A.3.8. SupposeJis continuously differentiable. If/is locally convex at x* and
      V/(x*) = 0, then x* is a local minimizer off

      In the last result, if/is in fact convex everywhere, then x* is a true global minimizer, by Proposi­
      tion A.3.5. The first-order necessary condition (A.2.t) thus becomes sufficient also. CNe use this
      result in Chapter 3 and elsewhere.) There is a comparable result for linearly constrained opti­
      mization:

      PROPOSITION A.3.9. Under the assumptions ofPropositionA.2.2, if/is loeally eonvex at x*,
      and (x*, ~*) satisfies (A.2.2) and (A.2.3), then x* is a local minimizer of/on X.

      Again, if/is truly convex, then x* is globally optimaL

        Convexity is preserved by optimization, in the following sense:


      PROPOSITION A.3.10. Suppose X and Yarc convex sets, and/ = lex, y) is convex on X X Y.
      Define g(x) to be the minimi31 value of/for fixed x, i.e., g(x) = min {lex, y) : y E Y}. Then, g is
      convexonX

      This fundamental result is used throughout the book.
         What if we aim to minimize a concave function? An element x of a convex set X is an extreme
      point if it is impossible to express x = AX 1 + (1 - A )x2 for x 1, x:;: to X; where x L ~ x and x2 ~ x.
      For instance, if X is a closed interval, its extreme points are its end points; if X is a convex poly­
      hedron, its extreme points are its vertices.

      PROPOSITION A.3.l1. If/is concave onX and there exists a global minimizer, then some ex­
      treme point of X is a global minimizer.
                                                                                                                                 IIIIIIIIIIIIII!IIIIIIIIIIIII_

B.l Definitions and Examples
A system is a collection of related elements. A dynamical S}.'stem is a system whose elements
change over time. Here are some examples:

     The solar system. The sun and the planets, plus the moons, comets, asteroids, et cetera.
     These bodies are related mainly by gravity.

     An electrical network. Resistors, capacitors, transistors, and other such elements,

     connected by wires.

     A production-distribution network. The manufacturiug and transportation facilities of a
     firm, and the inventories of physical items between them.

Here, of course, we are mainly interested in this third type of system, but the other two provide
useful analogies.
     These are real systems, but we are also interested in mode's of systems, primarily graphical
and mathematical models. Both are called "systems" in common usage. This appendix explores
deterministic systems exclusivcly; stochastic systems, whose behavior is affected by random
events, are discussed in AppendiX C.
     No real system exists entirely alone (except the entire universe). So, to discuss a system entails
a conceptual focus, implicit or explicit, on one part of the world, leaving out the rest. The bound­
my of a system distinguishes which elements are part of it and which are not. In most practical sit­
uations, it is obvious what the system is. that is, where its boundary belongs.
     But not always. People can and do argue over the "right" scope ofthe system. Of course, this
depends on the purpose of the discussion. For some purposes, the solar system can be regarded as
gravitationally independent of the rest of the universe, but for others it can't. Likewise, sometimes
it is usefullo discuss a firm's own production-distribution network by itself, but sometimes it is
essential 10 inel ude customers and suppliers.
     A .wbsystem is a system that is part of some larger system. TIle earth and its moon, for instance,
compose a subsystem of tile solar system. One particular item's inventory composes a subsystem
of a logistics system. Typically, a subsystem operates somewhat independeutly of the rest of the
system, so it is meaningful to focus attention on it.

R.LI Vocabulary
There is a general vocabulary for describing systems. We begin with four fundamental concepts,
input, output, state, and control.
   The inpuf of a system is a stimulus or driving foree, which enters the system from outside it<;
boundary. The input may be the flow of a physical substance, or infonnation from the environment.




                                                                                                   439
440   Foundations ofInventOlY Management


           For an electrical network, a battery might provide part of the input, in the fann of a voltage
      source. If the circuit is designed to operate an electric motor, the input might also include signals
      indicating the desired speed of the motor. The inputs to a production system include the raw ma­
      terials and infonnation about customer demands for finished goods.
           The output of a system measures the response or result of its operation. The definition of out­
      put depends on what aspects of the system's behavior interest us, or the purpose it is designed for.
      Also, the output must be something we can actually observe.
           For the motor-driving circuit above, the output might be the actual speed of the motor. A pro­
      duction system's output may simply be its production rate. We may also wish to observe, say, the
      fill rate (the fraction of demands satisfied immediately).
           The input and output, then, describe how a system interacts with its environment. The state of
      a system, in contrast, describes the internal workings of the system itself. The state is a eomplete
      description of the system's elements at a particular point in time. The key word here is complete.
      The state summarizes all available information about the system, past and present, that is useful
      in predicting its future evolution.
           In a cireuit, for example, the state describes the voltage at each node and the current on each
      arc ofthe network. The state of the solar system comprises the positions and velocities of the plan­
      ets. In a production-distribution system the state includes, at least, the inventory level of each item
      at each location.
           Sometimes. it is not obvious how to specify the state of a system; it may take some work to ar­
      rive at a satisfactory fonnulation. The "right" state description depends on the system's dynamics
      (discussed below). Astronomers care mainly about the positions ofthe planets, not their velocities.
      The velocities are necessary also, however, to predict future positions, because of the way gravity
      works.
           Likewise. the appropriate state of a production-transportation system depends on how the sys­
      rem operates. If it is hard to change a production rate, then thc state must include the current rate,
      in addition to the inventory levels. In a distribution network with delivery lags, thc state must de­
      seribe all shipments in transit, since those affect future inventory levels.
           Finally, a control is some action taken in order to modify the behavior of the system. Some­
      times, the control comes from outside the system, in which case it serves to modify the input. In
      other situations the control is intrinsic to the system itself, based on observing the actual output.
           For example, the circuit above may include a device to compare the desired and actual speeds
      of the motor, and to adjust the input voltage accordingly. The control of a logistics system might
      order materials and adjust production rates, based on current inventory levels.
           To complete the description of a system, we need some additional terminology, initial condi­
      tions, dynamics, constraints, and objective.
           The initial conditions specify the starting state of the system.                                     FJGUREB.L
           The dynamics of a system describes how the state and the output evolve over time. in response        Block diagram:
      to the input and the control. This is the fundamental core of a system.
           The dynamics ofthe solar system embody Newton's (or Einstein's) laws ofmotion. Other phys­
      icallaws (such as Ohm's and Kirchhoff's) govern the dynamics of an electric circuit. A logistics
      system's dynamics include stock-conservation laws: Ifwe start this week with certain inventories
      (the current state), then decide specific amounts to order and produce (controls), and then de­
      mands oecm (inputs), the dynamics speeify the inventories that will be left next wcek.
           Constraints place limits on the control actions or on the resulting values of the state. In most
      production systems a negative production quantity is meaningless, and positive values arc limited
      by production capacity; constraints codify these facts. Also, while negative inventory does have a
      meaning (it can be interpreted as a backlog, as explained in Chapter 3), we may wish to forbid it             Input
      nonetheless, and we can do this by imposing additional constraints.

                                          Finally, the objective is a summary measure of the system '5 performance. In the case of a
                                      production-distribution system, for example, we may be interested in the total cost over a long time
                                      interval, or perhaps the average cost over time. The performance of the circuit might be measured
                                      as the average squared difference between the desired and actual motor speeds. The solar system
                                      has no objective (as far as we know).

                                      B.1.2 Block Diagrams
                                      To understand these four key components-input, output. state and control-and how they work
                                      together, it is helpful to introduce another type of vocabulary, the formalism of block diagrams. A
                                      block diagram is a picture of a system in the form of a neh\'ork. Such diagrams can be drawn at
                                      differeut levels of detail or aggregation. These alternative pictures allow us to view a system from
                                      several different perspectives.
                                          At the highest level of abstraction, we can view a system simply as a device for translating in­
                                      put into output. Figure B.I.I expresses this view.
                                          The system itself is the rectangle or block in the center of the diagram. The input and output
                                      are depicted by arrows. In a diagram like this we regard the system as a black box; we see nothing
                                      of its internal structure.
                                          Figure B.I.2 provides a more detailed view of the system. including the state and the control
                                      as well as the input and output. All these components are nOW represented by arrows, and the
                                      blocks indicate transformations, through which each component affects the others.
                                          The right-most block shows that the output is detennined by a transformation ofthe state. The
                                      central block shows that the input and the control influence the state; also, the state affects itself.

      Finally, the left-most block tells us that the control depends on the input and also the output. Again,
      the diagram by itself does not tell us what happens inside the blocks, that is, the mechanisms of
      the corresponding transformations. (Some systems laek eertain afthe bloeks and arrows shown in
      the figure. For example, as mentioned above, the solar system has no real input, output or control,
      only dynamics.)
          There are yet more detailed diagrams, which show just how the blocks work. Alternatively, one
      can use a hierarchical diagram. This is actually a collection of diagrams, starting with figures like
      those above. It also includes additional diagrams, one for each of the blocks in Figure 8.1.2, show­
      ing the details ofthe block's transformation. And, some blocks in these additional diagrams may
      be supplemented by yet more diagrams showing still greater detail.


      B.2 Discrete-Time Systems
      B.2.1 Formulation

      Here is a fairly general mathematical model of a system. We model time as a scquencc of discrete

      time points. (This notion is explained further in Chapter 4.) There is no explicit output, or rather,

      the state itself is the output.


             T = timc horizon
             t = index for time points, t      = 0, ... , T
           X(I) ~ state
           z(l) = control
           e(l) ~ inpnt

      These last three are vectors. They need not have the same dimensions.
      Initial conditions:

                                                        X(O)   ~   Xo                                 (B.2.1)
      Dynamics:

                              x(1 + 1)   =   g[l, X(I), Z(I), e(I)]     I~   0, ... , T- I            (B.2.2)
      Constraints:

                                             x(l) eX       t = 0,       ,T                            (B.2.3)
                                             Z(I) e Z      t = 0,       , T- 1

      Objective:

                                     Minimize            ~;~Of[I. X(I), Z(I), e(I)]                   (B.2.4)

      Here, :!.t) is a given vector. X and Z are subsets, g is a vector function of its argwnents, and fis a
      scalar fimetion of the same arguments. (For t = T,fis a function only ofx(T).)
          This formulation describes ajirsf-order system, in that the next state x(t + I) depends only on
      the current state, control, and input, i.e., their values at time t, not at earlier times. Some systems,
      however, have higher-order dependencc. Fortunately, it is possible to modify the formulation, to
      reduce a higher-order system to a first-order one. For example, suppose x(t + I) depends on
      X(I - 1) as well x(f), Z(I), and .(f). Redefine the state to be Y(I) ~ [X(I), X(I - 1)]. Now, y(1 + 1)
      depends only on CUTrcnt values of the state, control, and input.

      B.2.2 The Optimality Principl. of Dynamic Programming
      Here is a method to solve problem (8.2.1) to (8.2.4). The idea is to start at t = T and then work
      backward in time.

                                                    V(t, xl   ~   min"{H(t, x, z) : ZE Z, g[l, x, z, .(/)] E XI            (8.2.5)

                       Continue all the way to t = O. The optimal value of the objective is given by V(O, xo). To construct
                       the optimal solution, work forward in time. Set z(O) to the optimal z in (B.2.5) for t = 0 with x =
                       Xu, and setx(l) to the corresponding g[O, X, z, e(O)]. Sct z(l) to the optimal z in (B.2.5) for t = 1
                       with x = x(l), and set x(2) to the corresponding g[l, x, z, e(l)]. Continue in this manner all the
                       waytot=T
                           This method works, in principle. The fact that it does so is called the optimality principle ofd.v­
                       namic programming.
                           In practice, the exact recursive solution of (B.2.5) can be a very demanding eomputation. It is
                       easy to make up problems which are essentially impossible to solve. Notice, (8.2.5) requires, for
                       each t, solving a separate optimization problem for each x. It is possible. however, to solve some
                       important problems exaetly, and various numerical approximation techniques ean be applied to
                       others.
                          Chapter 9 extends this idea to stochastie systems.


                       B.2.3 Linear-Quadratic Systems

                       Here is a special but important case. It has linear dynamics, quadratic objective, and no constraints.

                       Initial conditions:

           (B2.1,                                                             x(o)   = Xo

                       Here, A, B, C, Q and R are matrices of appropriate dimensions. (It is also possible for them to de­

                           This model is widely used to control physical systems, such as electric motors (one ofthe ex­

                       of the state variables and controls are meaningful (they just express opposite directions), and the
                       goal of the system is to control deviations, which the quadratic objective captures.
                           Chapter 4 discusses the application of this approaeh to an inventory system.

        The prime in the dynamics indicates the derivative with respect to t.

                   C.I Introduction
                   This appendix is a review of probability and stochastic processes. It also introduces nomencla­
                   ture, conventions, and notation used in the text. The material is mostly self-contained, but it is
                   both selective and informal: Many important subjects are left untouched, and many definitions
                   and arguments are intuitive rather than rigorous. The references in the Notes at the end provide
                   fuller expositions.
                       The concept of probability is truly one of the great and beantiful ideas of science and human
                   culture. It provides a clear, precise vocabulary for describing uncertainty and imprecision. Uncer­
                   tainty and imprecision are central elements of inventory systems.

                   will become known in the future. (There is a precise, technical definition, which we omit.) For ex­

                   ample, in modeling inventory systems, we consider quantities like the following:

                          The demand for a certain item over the next week
                          The leadtime for a replenishment order placed now
                           The demand for the item during the order leadtime
                           Whether or not a particular unit of the item turns out defective
                   Typieally, a random variable is indicated by a symbol, e.g., X
                       The range of a random variable is the set of possible values the quantity cau assume. For in­
                   stance, for weekly demand, the range might be the integers between 0 and 200; the order leadtime's
                   range might be all the non-negative real numbers; in the defeetive-unit example, the range might
                   be {O, I}, where I means defective and 0 means nondefective. An integer-valued random variable
                   is called discrete, and a real-valued one is called continuous. The range too is indicated by a sym­
                   bol, e.g., Sxor just S.
                       In addition to the range, the definition of a random variable includes the probability of each
                   subset of possible values. For instance, the probability that the demand during the leadtime is ex­
                   actly 93 might be 0.006, the probability that the leadtime exceeds 3.4 weeks might be 0.22, and
                   the probability of a nondefective unit might be 0.95. The abbreviation Pr {.} means the probabil­
                   ity of the event in brackets. If D denotes demand over the leadtime, for example, the first state­
                   ment above becomes Pr {D ~ 93) ~ 0.006.

         The realization of a random variable is the value that actually occurs, when all uncertainties
      have been resolved. For instance, D above describes a demand quantity bf{ore the period in ques­
      tion. .~tierthat period, we might observe a demand of 103; this is the realization of D.
          Sometimes we consider several related quantities, all uncertain. We can describe these as a 001­
      leetion of random variables or as a single, vector-valued random variable. (A stochastic process,
      defined later, is a special kind of colleetion of random variables.)


      C.2.2 Discrete Random Variables: General Properties
      Consider a discrete random variable X; whose range is S, a set of integers in some intervaL The
      probabilities for X can be expressed by the probability massfunction (abbreviated pmf). This is a
      function gx defined on S. whose meaning is

                                           gx(x) = Pr {X = x}                  X €   S

      Thus, gx(x) 2: 0, X € S, and ~x~ gx(x) = 1. It is sometimes useful to extend the function gx to all
      the integers, setting gx(x) =    °
                                      for x rl S. When the symbol X is understood, we write g for gx.
      (Some people refer to gxas the probability density function; this phrase has a different but related
      meaning in the context of continuous random variables.)
          A mode of gxis a value x at which gx(.:t) is a local maximum. We say gx is unimodal when it
      has only one mode (or more generally when all the modes are contiguous).
         The probability distribution or cumulative distn'butionfunction (abbreviated cdf) of X is

                                   Gx(x) ~ Pr{X-ox) ~ ~y~xK,(Y)                          xeS

      The complementary cumulative distribution /imction (or ecdf) is

                                    G.';.(x) ~ Pr IX>x) ~l - Gtix)                       xeS

      Again, we write G and GO when X is understood.

        The mean or expectation of X is


                                                     E[X] ~ ~x.sxg(x)

      (When S is infinite, the series need not converge, in which case E[X] does not exist; even when
      E[X] exists, it may be infinite. We nearly always assume that E[X] exists and is finite. The same
      goes for similar series below.) More generally, if h is some function defined on S, the expectation
      of II(X) is

                                              E[II(X)] ~ ~,.s h(x)g(x)

      In particular, if n is a positive integer,

                                                   E[X"] ~ ~x.s x"g(x)

      is called the nth moment of X E[.X] itself is the first moment. The variance of X is

                                   VEX] ~ E[X2 ]              -   (E[X])' ~ E[(X - E[X])']

      A related quantity is the second binomial moment of;r, Z;E[A:"(A:" - 1)]. The standard deviation of
      X is the square root of its variance. For a random variable X with E[X] positive, the coefficient of
      variation is the ratio of its standard deviation to its mean, i.e., (V[X])"~/E[X].
          The z-tran.~torm of X (also called the probability generatingfimction, or pgf) is
                                                              g(z) ~ E[zx]

      (This function is defined for those =such that the expectation exists. Such z can be complex num­
      bers as well as real ones.) This function has a number of important uses. For example, E[X] =




                                                                                                                                        ~

      C.2.3 Discrete Random Variables: Examples

      Next, we review some important types of discrete probability distributions. (Section C.4.4 dis­ 

      cusses another important family, the discrete phase-type distributions.)


      C.2.3.t Beruoulli Distribution

      In this case S = {a, I}. A random variable X of this kind represents a choice between yes and no,

      or on and off, or success and failure, etc. For instance, X = 1 might mean that a particular unit pro­ 

      duced is defective, \vhile X = a means the unit is good.

          This distribution has a single parameter p, where p = PI {X = I}. That is,
                                             g(O)   ~    1- p             g(l)    ~P

      Thus,
                           E[X]   ~   P      V[X]    ~   p(l - p)              g(z)   ~   (l - p)    + pz

      C.2.3.2 Binomial Distribution

      This type has two parameters, 11 and p, and S = {O, 1, ... , n}. Here, X can be viewed as the sum

      ofn independent random variables, eaeh having a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p. For in­

      stance, X might indicate the number of defectives out of 11 total units produced.

                    case g is unimodaL Also, for p = ~,g is symmetric about the mean ~n. In general, exchangingp
                    and I - p results in a reflection of g about the vertical line at x = ~n. All binomial distributions

      C.2.3.4 Poisson Distribution
      A Poisson distribution has a single parameter A > 0, and S is the non-negative integers. The pmf is

                                                   )<,,"e_ A
                                                g(,)~~                  x~o



      and

                                                    E[X]     ~   VEX]   ~   A

      Also,
                                                      g(z)   ~   e-A(I-.)

         The pmf is easy to compute by the recursion
                                             g(O)~e-A


                                             g(x)   ~ (;)g(X - 1)               x~l


      There is no closed form expression for G. The simplest way to compute it is to sum terms ofg di­
      rectly. (This approach is fast and accurate enough for most purposes, provided x is not too large.
      For large x, sophisticated numerieal methods are required; see, e.g., Kniisel [1986] and Fox and
      Glynn [1988].) The loss functions can be written in terms of GO as
                               GI(x) ~ -(x - A)Go(x)             + Ag(x)
                               G'(x) ~ X{[(x - A)'           + x]Go(x)      - A(x - A)g(x)}

      [These identities are (6.2.14) to (6.2.15) in Chapter 6.]
          Figure C.2.2 graphs the Poisson pmf for four different values of A. Notice, g is wlirnodal in
      each case, and the mode occurs near the mean A. (Specifically, when A is a positive integer, both
      A-I and A are modes; otherwise, the single mode is the integer part of A.) Several of the figures
      in Chapter 6 illustrate the loss function,
          Consider a sequence of binomial distributions, with n inereasing to 00, but p adjusted to
      maintain a constant mean A, i.e.,p = A/n. Then, the limit is a Poisson distribution with the same
      meanA.
          The Poisson distribution is used extensively to model the demand for an item over a fixed time
      interval, as discussed in Chapter 6.

      C.2.3.5 Ge{)metric Distributi{)n

      Here, S is the non-negative integers, and there is a single parameter p with 0 < P < 1. Consider

      an infinite sequence of independent variables, each having the Bernoulli distribution with param­ 

      eter p. (This is called a Bernoulli sequence or Bernoulli process.) Then, Xis the number of l's be­

      fore the first 0 is observed.

          Thc geometric distribution is commonly used to model the time until some event occurs, like
      the failure of a machine, where there is a constant probability of failure, regardless of the age of
      the machine. It arises also in Chapter 7, describing demand over a stochastic leadtime.
         We have

                            g(x)   ~   (l - p)p'        <1'(x) ~ p x+l           x~o

      C.2.3.6 Negative-Binomial Distribution
      Again, S is the non-negative integers. There are two parameters, nand p, with 0 < P < 1 and
      n> O.
          Suppose n is a positive integer. We can think of X as the sum of n independent random vari­
      ables, each having a geometric distribution. Equivalently, Xis the number of D's before n 1's occur
      in a Bernoulli sequence. Thus, X might represent the time until n identical maemnes fail. In this
      case,

                                   g(x) ~     ("-I+X) p(l - p)"
                                                      x                             XES


      The same formula applies even when n is not an integer if the binomial coefficient is interpreted
      as


                                          (
                                              " - I    +    x) ~     f(n + x)
                                                  x                f(n)f(x + 1)

      where r is the gamma function. The geometric distribution is the special case with n = 1.
        We have

                                                                               np
                                     E[X]~~                        VEX]
                                                 1- p                      (1 - p)'


                                       ge,) ~ ( 1 - pz
                                                      I -   p)"
      Here is a useful reeursion for the pmf:

                                  g(O)    ~   (l - p)"

                                   g(x)   ~
                                              (n-l+X) pg(x -
                                                      X                   1)        x   2::::   1

      (Thus, even when n is not an integer, we never actually have to compute the function r.) There is
      no closed-form formula for cP, G 1 , or G2 • The loss functions can be expressed in telms of GO and
      g, however. Let ~ ~ pl(l - p), so E[X] ~ n~.

              G1(x) ~ -(x -,,~)d'(x) + (x        + n)~g(x)
              G'(x) ~ ~(["(,, + 1)~' - 2,,~x + x(x + 1)]Go(x) + [en + 1)~ - x](x + nWg(x))

          Figure C.2.3 shows several negative-binomial pmf's, for p = 0.75 and four different values of
      n. (The case n  = I is a geometric pmf.) Evidently, as n increases, the mean increases, and the dis­
      tribution seems to become more spread out. Figure C.2.4 again examines four values of n, but now
      p is adjusted to keep the mean fixed at 9. Here, increasing n serves to concentrate the distribution;
      the variance decreases with n. In all cases, g is unimodaL Figure 7.5.1 illustrates the loss function.
          The negative-binomial distribution is widely used to model demand over a (stochastic) lead­
      time, as in Chapter 7.
          Consider a sequence of negative-binomial distributions with n increasing to GO, butp adjusted
      to maintain a constant mean A. This sequence converges to a Poisson distribution with the same
      mean. Thus, the Poisson distribution is a limiting case of the negativewbinomiaL (We mentioned a
      similar property above for the ordinary binomial distribution.)

      tation and results ean be used in this case: The mean of X is the column vector E[X] = (E[Xa)7=lo
      The covariance manix of X is the n X n matrix V[X] = (V[X;., ~·n~.j=" This matrix is always
      symmetric and non-negative-definite.

           Figure C.2.6 shows four gamma pdf's with a cornmon mean of 1, but different values ofn (so
      I..L =n). Evidently, the distribution becomes more concentrated near the mean for larger n.

          The special case v = 0,0' = 1 is very important, and there is a special voeabulary and notation
      for it. The random variable is called Z instead of X Z has the standard normal distribution. The
      pdf of Z is called the standard nonnal pdf

                             The central limit theorem says roughly tbe following: Suppose X is the sum of many inde­
                         pendent random variables. Then, the distribution of Xis approximately normal. For example, sup­
                         pose that demand for an item over some time period comes from many independent sources. Then,
                         the total demand is approximately normal.
                            There is also the multivariate normal distribution for a vector of random variables. We begin
                         with a special case: Let Z = (Z;)7=1 be a column vector of independent random variables, each
                         having the standard normal distribution abovc. Thus,

      C.3 Stochastic Processes
      c..'.• Definition
      A stochastic process is a model of a quantity that evolves over time, just like a dynamical system,
      but one influenced by random faclors. In the study of inventory systems, stochastic processes are
      used to model demands and supplies that are affected by unpredictable events. as well as key vari­
      ables sueh as net inventory.
          Fonnally, a stochastic process is a collection of random variables X = {X(t) : t ~ A}, where
      X(t) denotes the quantity of interest at time t. Time maybe discrete, where t ranges over the non­
      negative integers, or continuous. Each X( t) itself may be discrete or continuous, or a vector of such
      variables. To define a stochastic process X means to specify, at least implicitly, the joint range and
      probability distributions of all these random variables. (Not every such collection meaningfully
      represents a quantity evolving over time. As time passes. the early XU) are realized, and we ob­
      serve those realizations, at least partially, while later XU) remain uneertain. Thus, information is
      revealed gradually over time. There is a precise, teehnical way to express this notion, called a fil­
      tration. Suffice it to say that all the processes here work in this manner.)
          A sample path ofX describes a realization ofall the random variablesX(t). Thus, a sample path
      is a definite function of time.
          In principle, the ranges of the X(t) may be different, but in most practical cases the XCt) share
      a common range, denoted S, called the state space of X. An element of S is a state. X(t) itself is
      referred to as the state variable. (These usages are most appropriate for a Markov process, dis­
      cussed below, but they are commonly applied to other processes too.)
          There are many different kinds of stochastic processes. We now sketch some of the major dis­
      tinctions.


      C.3.2 Classification
      C.3.2.t Time
      The time parameter f can be continuous (real) or discrete (integer). Depending on this choice, we
      say X is a continuous-time process or a discrete-time process.

                               The specification of time is a basic modeling choiee, for a stochastic process just as for a de­
                           terministic system. In some cases there is a natural, predetermined time scale; observations and
                           decisions may take place at regular (e.g., weekly), scbeduled points in time, or they may occur con­
                           tinuously. Often, however, the choice is more one of convenience; one type may be easier to ana­
                           lyze than the other. Indeed, the differences between discrete- and continuous-time models are
                           rarely fundamental. These modeling issues are discussed further in Chapters 4 and 9.

                           C.3.2.2 Space
                           Regardless of how we model time, the random variables X(t) themselves may be discrete or con­
t (lis n:J8i'S are . .     tinuous; in these cases, respectively, X is called a discrete-state or continuous-state process. With

                           An important distinction, both in continuous and in discrete time, is whether Dr not a process

                           cisely, a process X is stationary if a shift in the time axis leaves its probability law unchanged. That

                           is, first, the X(t) all have the same (marginal) distribution, as viewed just before time O. Second,

                           for any fixed u > 0, the pair [X(t), X(t + u)] has the same distribution for all t. Likewise, the dis­

      sfationalY increments if Xu is stationary for all u  > O. This is the natural concept of time­
      invariance for an accumulation process. It implies that E[X(t)J = E[X(I)]t, t 2: O. For example,
      if the (cumulative) demand process has stationary increments, then demand during any week has
      the same distribution. (Sometimes, we loosely describe a process as "stationary" when we rc­
      ally mean stationary increments; the context usually makes the intended meaning clear.)

      C.3.2.5 Ergodicity and Independence

      Among stationary processes X, some have an important property, ergodicity; a process with this

      property is ergodic. The precise definition is rather technical, and we omit it, but its major conse­ 

      quence is worth mentioning: Consider any sample path. and calculate the long-run frequency dis­

      tribution of X(t) on that path. For example, if X(t) is integer-valued, compute the long-run fraction

      of time X(t) spends on each of the integers. IfX is ergodic, then this frequency distribution is iden­

      tical to the probability distribution of X(O). (Actually, this identity holds for "almost all" sample

      paths, i.e., with probability 1.) In particular, the average of X(I) over I is E[X(O)].

          Consider a stationary, discrete-time process X, and suppose that the X(t) are mutually inde­
      pendent. Then, the property above holds; this is precisely the strong law of large numbers. An er­
      godic process, then, is one to which the strong law applies, whether or not the X(t) are indepen­
      dent. (For example, let Y(I) ~ X(I) + XU + 1), where the XU) are independent. It is not hard to
      show that Y is ergodic, even though the yet) are not independent.)
          Ergodicity is a remarkable and useful property. The distribution of X(O) embodies information
      on the likelihoods of all possible sample paths. The frequency distribution, in contrast, describes
      the behavior of X on one sample path. It is a striking fact that these two distributions are identical
      for certain (namely, ergodic) processes.
          To appreciate this property, consider a stationary X that is not ergodic: Time is discrete, and thc
      state space is S ~ {O, I}. For X(O), each value has probability li. Then, for all I > 0, X(I) ~ X(O).
      Thus, cach sample path is either {D, 0, 0, ... } or {I, 1, 1, ... }. So, the proportion of D's is never
      l1, which is Pr{X(O) = D}. (Herc, of course, the X(t) are not independent.) Such things are impos~
      sible for an ergodic process.
          Turning now to a different property, a (discretc- or continuous-time) process X has indepen­
      dent increments ifits increments over disjoint time intervals are independent. This implies thatX(t)
      andX,lt) arc independent, for all t and u. That is, the current value provides no information about
      future increments. This property is especially relevant for an accumulation process, e.g., demand.
      In this case, the demands during different weeks are independent random variables.

      C.3.2.6 Markov Processes
      Appendix B explains the notion of the state of a system. The state constitutes a full description of
      the system at any point in time. In a deterministic system, the state summarizes all the available
      information relevant to predicting the future evolution ofthe system. There is a similar concept for
      stochastic systems. A stochastie process that has been formulated in tenns of an appropriate statc
      is called a A.farkov process.
          Here is the basic idea: Suppose we find ourselves at time t. We observe the current value X(t),
      and also we remember the realizations of past values, namely X(s), 0 ::5 S < t. Suppose we are in­
      terested in some future value, say XU + u) for u > D. Now. we cannot predictX(t + u) perfectly,
      but the information we have may tell us something about X( t + u). The question is, how much of
      that infonnation is really salient? If X is a Markov process, then X(t) itself embodies all the rele­
      vant information; the other X(s) add no further information. In short, conditional on the present,
      the future is independent ofthe past. For this reasonX(t) is called the state variable or state of the
      process X. (An element of the state space S is also called a state; the context usually indicates
      which meaning applies.)

                                        in the discrete-time case, it suffices to specify the conditional distributions of [X(t + 1) IX(t)] for

                                            Sometimes, starting with a non-Markov process X, there is a way to refonnulate the model as
                                        a Markov process. This usually involves adding auxiliary variables. That is, we identify another
                                        process Y, such that the joint process (X, Y) is a Markov process. (This is entirely analogous to in­

      where the matrix pi is the lith power of P That matrix thus specifies the u-step transition proba­
      bilities.
          To complete the specification of X, we need only initial conditions, i.e., the starting stateX(O),
       or more generally, the distribution of X(O). Often, however, we are interested in the family of
       proccsses with a given Sand P, covering all possible initial distributions; it is common to refer to
       the whole family as a Markov chain.
           To aid modeling and intuition, it is useful to rcpresent Sand P by a directed graph ealled the
      state-transition diagram: There is a node for each state i E S. There is an arc from node i to nodc
      j, whenpij > O. Thus, the arcs indicate which transitions can occur. (Sometimes the Pi) are attached
      to the arcs, but sometimes they are omitted to avoid clutter.)
           For example, consider a three-state chain with S = {l, 2, 3} and

                                                                                J)
      Figure C.4.1 shows the     state~transition diagram.             (There is an arc from node I to itself, because
      p" > 0.)
          When S is infinite, of course, we cannot draw the whole graph. Still, there may be a pattern or
      structure in P that can be indicated graphically. For example, suppose S = (0, 1,2, ... }, and for
      all i

                                                 Pi,i+l   = X            Pi+2,i = ~

      Figure C.4.2 shows the diagram. Fortunately, most Markov chains encountered in practice do have
      fairly simple structures, reflecting the dynamics of the systems they model. (This faet is important
      in analysis too, as explained later.)

      of a vector. The initial vector nCO) is part ofthe specification of X. For t > 0, net) describes X(t)

                        and only then, X is a stationary process. Equations (CA.2) are called the balance equations.
                        DEFINITION. The probability vector n°O is limiting if, for every initial vector 1T(D),
                                                                      limHoo 1T(t) = n ""

                        A limiting vector, if it exists, is clearly unique.
                            The analysis of Markov chains addresses the following fundamental questions: When does a
           rC.·U,       stationary probability vector exist? If one exists, when is it unique, and how call we compute it?
                        When does a limiting probability vector exist? Is it stationary? How do these vectors describe the
                        sample-path behavior of the chain?
                            For certain chains, the answers are simple, but for others they are not.

      CA.3 Classification and Analysis
      C.4.3.1 Finite State Space
      First, assume S is finite. This case is relatively easy. For instance, the first question above has a
      straightforward answer:
      PROPOSITION CA.!. There exists at least one stationary vector.
         To address the other questions, we need to consider carefully what types of transitions can occur.

      DEFINITION. State j is reachable from state i if, in the state-transition diagram, there is a
      path from i toj. States i and} communicate if each is reachable from the other.
      In terms of P, j is reachable from i if (PU)ij > 0 for some u > o. Clearly, we can partition S into
      subsets Sk) such that all the states within each subset communicate, but states in different subsets
      do not.
          In Figure CA. I, aU three statcs communicate, so there is only one subset, S itself. Figure CA.3
      shows a seven-state chain with three subsets; the subsets are indicated by rectangles and indexed
      by letters.
          Also, we say that one subset is reachable from another, if any state in the second subset is reach­
      able from any state in the first. (In this case, clearly, every state in the second is reachable from
      every state in the first.) However, two subsets eannot communicate, or else wc would combine
      them into one. In Figure CA.3, subsets So and Sc are reachable from SA'
      DEFINITION. A subset Sk is transient if some other subsct is reachable from it. Otherwise, Sk
      is recurrent.
      A transient subset is literally transient; if X starts in the subset, sooner or later X must leave it,
      never to return. Conversely, if X starts in a recurrent SUbset, it stays there forever. There is always
      at least one recurrent subset. ill Figure CA.3, SB and Sc are recurrent, while SA is transient. (The
      states in a transient subset are themselves called transient: likewise, there are recurrent states.)
      DEFINITION. A Markov chain is reducible ifthere is more than one recurrent subset. Otherwise,
      it is irreducible.
      Thc long-tenn behavior of a reducible chain thus depends crucially on its initial conditions; start­
      ing in one recurrent subset, X can never reach another one. The chain in Figure CA.3 is reducible,
      while the one in Figure CA.I is irreducible.
      PROPOSITION CA.2. An irreducible chain has a unique stationary probability vector, 'iT-.
      Conversely, a reducible chain has several stationary vectors.
      PROPOSITION C.4.3. In an irreducible chain, the stationary vcctor 11'- describes the long­
      run frequency distribution of X for almost every sample path, regardless of 11'(0).
          Next, consider the chains in Figure CAA. The first cycles indefinitely through three states. The
      second is less predictable, but still it alternates between the groups of stales {I, 2} and {3, 4}.
      (Both are irreducible.) Such chains are called periodic. We shall skip the formal definition; the in­
      tuitive idea should be clear. A chain without such systematic cycles is called aperiodic.
      PROPOSITION C.4.4. An irreducible, aperiodic chain has a (unique) limiting probability
      vector, 'iTe<>. Furthermore, 'iTe<> = 'iT -.

          A chain with all these properties is called ergodic. Recall, Section C.3.2.5 discusses this term
      in the context of a general stochastic process. Here, the usage is a bit different. An irreducible chain
      with'iT(D) = 1T - has the key property of an ergodic process in the original sense, by Proposition

      8-8-0-0-8" .
          Given this new definition of recurrent subsets, the notions of reducible and irreducible chains
      remain the same as before; that is, a nontransient chain is irreducible if it has only one recurrent
      subset.
          There are now two distinct kinds of recurrent subsets: Suppose X{O) = i, where i is recurrent.
      So, X will return to i in the future, with probability 1. Consider the first-return time, that is. the
      earliest time t > 0 withX(t) = i. If the mean of the firstwretum time is finite, i is positive recur·
      rent; othenvise, if the mean is infinite, i is null recurrent. It turns out that either all states in are·
      current subset are positive recurrent or all are null recurrent, so these terms characterize subsets.
      (For finite S, every recurrent subset is positive recurrent.) Null-recurrent subsets appear only
      rarely; we shall see an example in the next section.
          We now make an assumption:
      ASSUMPTION. There is at least one positive-recurrent subset.
      (Recall, this is always true when S is fInite.) It turns out that, under this condition, the results above
      for the finite-state case remain valid: There is a stationary vector (as in Proposition CA.l). Ifthe
      chain is irreducible, the stationary vector is unique (Proposition C.4.2), and it characterizes the
      long-run frequency distribution of X (Proposition C.4.3). If the chain is also aperiodic, there is a
      limiting vector, which equals the stationary vector (Proposition CA.4).
                        Appendix C Probability and Stochastic Processes                                                      469

                            There is no direct general method to check positive recurrenee. However, it turns out that the
                        assumption above holds, if and only if a stationary vector exists. One (and usually the easiest) way
                        to check the assumption, then, is to try to solve the balance and normalization equations (CA.2)
                        and (CA.3); success means the assumption holds. Unfortunately, there is now an infinite number
                        of equations in an infinite number of variables; there is no general procedure to solve snch sys­
                        tems. Fortunately. many chains have speeial structure, and it is often possible to exploit that struc­
                        ture to solve the system.

                        C.4.3.3 Absorbing Chains

                        Let us now define an important class of Markov chains. The state space S can be finite or infinite.

                            An absorbing state i is one having Pii = 1, so Pu = O,j ::;6 i. Thus, once X arrives in an ab­
                        sorbing state, it never leaves. Clearly, every absorbing state forms its own subset, and each is pos­
                        itive recurrent. An absorbing Markov chain is one where every state is either transient or absorb­
                        ing; therefore, X will enter an absorbing state sooner or later, and then stay put.
                            An absorbing chain is irreducible, then, when it has precisely one absorbing state. In this case,
                        thc long-run behavior of the chain is obvious and uninteresting. (The absorbing state has 'IT -; = 1.)
                        Its short-term ("transient") behavior, however, ean be interesting indeed, as we see next.

                        C.4.4 Discrete Phase-Type Distribution

                        Next, we describe a type of probability distribution defined in terms of an absorbing chain. Con­

                        sider a finite-state, absorbing, irreducible chain X, i.e., with a single absorbing state. Renumber

                        the states, if necessary, so that the absorbing state comes last.

                            We revise the notation slightly: Use P to denote, not the full transition matrix, but rather only
                        the submatrix corresponding to transient states, leaving out the last row and column; let Pall de­
                        note the full matrix. So,

                                                                          _(P0 (1-1p)e)
                                                                     Pall -

          To evaluate these quantities requires no more, but no less, than standard numerical tactics for
      solving linear systems. To compute GO(I), for instance, start with the eolumn-vector e. Premulti­
      ply by Pto obtainPe; premultiply again to obtainp2 e ; continue in this manner to obtain pte. Then,
      multiply by the row-vector '1T to yield GO(I). To compute Gl(t), follow the same procedure, but at
      the last stcp use the row-vector 'IT(l - P)-t instead of 'IT.
          This approach works well for small t. For large t, something else is required. Here are two ap­
      proaches: First, compute the power-of-two powers of P (P, p2, p4, p8, etc.) by direct multiplica­
      tion. Then, following thc binary representation of t, premultiply e by the appropriate subset of
      thcse matrices to obtain pte, and proceed as above. (For example, p I8 e = pI6p2 e .)
          Alternatively, start by computing the spcctral decomposition of P. That is, express P in the form
      p = ADA-l, where D is a "simple" matrix. (Often, D is a diagonal matrix.) Then, pt = ADfA- i .
      Because D is simple, it is easy to compute D t directly for any t.
          Some of the formulas become simpler in the special ease where 'IT can be written as 'IT = lfIP
      for some probability vector lfI with \fie = 1. Then,

                                             g(1) ~ "'(!- P)P'e              I"" 0

                                             g(=) ~   "'(1-        P)(!- Zp)-Ie

      For example, a geometric distribution has precisely this form; there is only onc transient state,
      P = (p), and \fI = (1). Thus, this subclass ofDPH distributions generalizes the geometric distri­
      butions; the matrix P plays the same role as the scalar p. Similarly, a general DPH distribution is
      the matrix analogue of a delayed geometric distribution (see Section C.2.3.5). Here, 'IT is analo­
      gous to 'IT, and P to p.
          Phase-type distributions are quite flexible: Consider the sum, or a mixture, or the minimum, or
      the maximum, of several independent random variables, each with a DPH distribution. Each such
      combination also has a DPH distribution. Also, any distribution on the nonnegative integers can
      be approximated as closely as desired hy a DPH distribution.



      C.S Markov Chains: Continuous Time
      C.S.1 Definition and Dynamics

      A continuous-time Markov chain X is a discrete-state, continuous-time, time-homogeneous

      Markov process. (1bis is identical to the earlier definition of a Markov chain, except for the con­ 

      tinuous time parameter.)

                               Pi;   =0
                             • A vector () = (Eli)i"S' where each Eli > 0
                        Construet the process X = {X(t) : t 2:: O} as follows: The state space of X too is S. The sequence
                        of values is precisely that of the discrete-time chain X E . The time X spends in state i on each visit
                        there, however, is a random variable, distributed exponentially with parameter Eli- These times are
                        independent of X E and of each other.
                            So, on entering state i, X stays there for an exponential amount of time with mean lIEl r Then,
                        a transition occurs to another state, according to the probabilities in the matrix P The discrete­
                        time chain X E is said to be embedded in X (which explains the superscript E). This X, then, is
                        a continuous-time Markov chain.
                            Here is another, equivalent way to specify the data and to construct X, without reference to X E :
                        Define the matrix Q = (q i)' where

                        Notice that Pe = e implies Qe = O. Q is called the (infinitesimal) generator ofX. Then, X oper­
. Bi:re are "'" lip­    ates as follows: Suppose X is now in state i. Over a small increment of time At, the probability of

                            Thus, as long as X remains in state i, qij measures the potential of a jump to j,j 7'= i; it is called

a.P'=A..DxA- t _            The generator Q thus fully describes the behavior ofX. To fonnulate X, we can specify Q di­
                        rectly, bypassing P and 6. (Indeed, starting with a square matrix Q, having negative diagonal and
~as'iO=~                non-negative off-diagonal entries, such that Qe = 0, we can easily recover P and 6.)
                            The state-transition diagram for a continuous-time chain has nodes and arcs defined as in the
                        discrete-time case: There is a node for each state, and an arc from i to j when qij > 0, j 7'= i. (There
                        is never an arc from i to itself, since Pit = 0.) The transition rates qif are used as labels on the arcs,

                                       E
      irreducible or periodic, when X has the corresponding property. Furthcnnore. the definitions of
      recurrent, positive-recurrent, and null~recurrent subsets are the same as in the discrete-time case;
      and when S is finite. every recurrent subset is also positive-recurrent.
          The only exception concerns positive-recurrence in the case of an infinite state space S. Now,
      we need fuio assumptions in place of the one in Section CA.3:
      ASSUMPTION 1. The embedded discrete-time chain X E has at least one positive~recurrent
      subset.
      This is the assumption of Section CA.3 for the discrete-time case. Recall, this implies that X E has
      a stationary vector, say     -rr-.
      ASSUMPTION 2. The following qnantity is finite:
                                                                          "B­

      (Think of lie as the average timc until X leaves its current state, with the current state chosen ran­
      domly according to -rr E -.) Clearly, both assumptions are satisfied automatically when S is finite.
         Under these two assumptions, X has a stationary vector 11 -, given by
                                                                   'IT-'?78.

              When additionally X E (and hence X) is irreducible, this is the unique stationary vector; in that

              We now consider a simple but important type of continuous-time Markov chain, a birth-death
              process. Here, S is the non-negative integers. From each state, a transition can occur only to one
              of its nearest neighbors. Among discrete-state processes, a birth-death process is the closest ana­

              logue to a continuous process.
                  Such chains are used to model populations of people or animals. A transition upward repre­
              sents a birth, and a transition downward a death (hence the name birth-death process). There are
              many other applications, e.g., to supply systems, as discussed below.
                  A birth-death process has an infinite S, but still is highly structured. Using this structure, we
              can detennine whether the chain has a stationary vector and, if so, compute it:

              For a birth-death process, all the other qi, = 0, i oF j. Assume all the   j.L,   are positive; Ihis implies X
              is irreducible. For now, assume all the Ai are positive also.

                                                R   = I~=oR,

      The balance equations are equivalent to

                                                'iTt   = Rj 7ff)           i   ~   0

      The normalization equation then reduces to

                                                 1 = I~=o 'IT{           = R'Ti'o

      If R is finite, the equations have the unique solution

      and 1T - = ('iT ~)i is the unique stationary and limiting vector. Otherwise, if R = 00, there is no so­
      lution, and the chain is either transient or null-recurrent.
            For example, suppose all the Ai = A and the I-li = I-l, where A. and I-l are positive constants. (This
      case describes a simple queue, the MIMI! system.) Then, Pi = P = A11-l, i > 0, so R; = pi, i ~ o.
      Therefore, R is finite, if and only if p < 1, in which case R = 1/(1 - p). Here, the stationary vec­
      tor describes a geometric distribution with parameter p, that is, 'lTi - = (l - p)pi, i ~ O. If p ~ 1,
      there is no stationary vector. It turns out that X is transient when p > 1, and null-recurrent when
      p ~ 1.
            Now, consider the case where some of the Ai = O. Let s + 1 be the smallest such i. Now, all
      states i > s are transient. Ignoring these transient states, we can think of X as describing afinite­
      state chain on the state space {O, 1, ... , s}. This model is called afinite birth-death process. In
      this case, R is always finite (because Ri = 0, i > s), and the stationary vector is computed as above.
            In the special case where Ai = A and l-li = J.L, i::s: s (a finite MIMI! queue), there is a station­
      ary vector for any value of p. For p ¥- 1, R = (1 - ps-t-l)/(l - p), so 'IT "7 = (1 - p)pi/(l - ps+l), i
      ::s: s. For p = 1, 'IT - describes a unifonn distribution: 'IT; = 1/(s + 1), i::s: s.

      C.5.5 Continuous Phase-Type Distribution

      Next, we introduce a continuous probability distribution, analogous to the discrete phase-type dis­

      tribution of Section C.4.4. Just as the latter is defined in terms of a discrete-time Markov chain,

      this new distribution is constructed from a continuous-time chain.

          Suppose X is a continuous-time Markov chain with generator Qall and a specified initial vec­
      tor ....alf. The last state is an absorbing state, and we partition the data as follows:


                                                                                   M~)

      The vector .... describes the initial probabilities ofthe transient states, so .... ~ 0, J.1e $ 1. As for M,
      its diagonal is positive, the off-diagonal entries are nonpositive, and Me ~ 0; in addition, Mis non­
      singular. (The latter property ensures that X is an absorbing chain.)

                          Again, let T be the time until absorption. Arguing as in Section CA.4, one can show that the

                           If J1e < I. then Pr {T = O} > 0, so FTis not purely continuous. Nevertheless, we include this
                       case among the CPR distributions. Also, - M is more commonly used as the matrix parameter than
                       M itself; we find M more convenient.
                           One can show that Pr (T ~ 0 j = 1 - I'e, and fort> 0, T has pdf

                            A Poisson process is a special continuous-time Markov chain. The state-transition diagram is

                       j + 1 (e.g., a demand occurring) during a short time At is about AfAt). (This chain is transient.)
                            For each t > 0, the random variable D(t) has the Poisson distribution with mean At. Also, let
                       T J denote the time of the first demand, and T" the time between the (1'1 - l)st and nth demands,
                       1'1 ~ 1. Then, the Tn are independent random variables, each having the exponential distribution
                       with mean VA.
                            These processes have some important conservation properties: Consider two independent Pois­

           Conversely, consider a Poisson process D with rate A and a Bernoulli sequence {Xn : n :=:: I}
      (Section C.2.3.5) with parameter p, independent ofD. Now, construet a pair of processes D 1 and
      D2 as follows: At the instant the nth point ofD occurs, examineXn- If..:(, = 1, assign this point to
      D t , that is, incrementDJ(t) by one at the same instant; otherwise, ifXn = 0, assign the point to the
      other process D z- The pair (D b D 2 ) is called a splitting ofD. It turns out that both D 1 and D 2 are
      Poisson processes, with respective rates:\l = p"A and A2 = (1 - p)"A, and they are independent.
           Sometimes, we are interested only in D t ; in effect, we "throwaway" the points assigned to D2 .
      The process D 1 by itself is called a thinning ofD. A thinning of a Poisson process, then, is itself a
      Poisson process.
           Furthermore, consider a large number of independent, stationary counting processes, not nec­
      essarily Poisson processes, and consider the superposition of all of them. Provided certain regu­
      larity conditions are satisfied, this superposition behaves approximately like a Poisson process, at
      least over a relatively short time interval. (This fact is sometimes referred to as the central limit
      theorem for counting processes. It explains why so many actual, observed counting processes ap­
      pear much like Poisson processes.)
           A renewalprocess is a counting process whose interevent times Tn are independent, identically
      distributed random variables. The Tn can have any distribution. A Poisson process is the special
      case where the distribution of the T" is exponential.


      C.6 Stochastic Linear Systems in Discrete Time
      C.6.1 Formulation
      This section briefly discusses a discrete-time linear system whose input is stochastic. (In other
      ways the system is somewhat special; there is no control and no objective.)
         Here is the basic notation:

              t = index for time.points, t = 0, ...
           x(t) = state at time t, a real-valued n-vector
           e(t) = input at time t, a real-valued m-vector

      All vectors are column vectors. The e(t) represent pure noise. Specifically, the vectors e(t) are in­
      dependent over t, and for all t,

                                            E[e(I)] = 0      V[e(I)]   ~   I

      Assume that each e(t) has a normal distribution. (This assumption is unnecessary for many of the
      results, but it helps to sharpen the discussion.) Thus, each e(t) is a vector of independent random
      variables, each with a standard normal distribution. The initial value Xo may be a fixed constant or
      more generally a random variable with a given normal distribution.
         The system operates according to the following equations:
      Initial conditions:
                                                    x(O)   ~ Xo

      Dynamics:
                                    X(I   + 1) = Ax(t) + Se(l)         t = 0, ...

      Here, A is a constant n X n matrix, while S is a constant n X m matrix. The collection X =
      {x(t) : t :=:: O} describes a stochastic process. This is a Markov process, beeause the e(t) are inde­
      pendent over t. It is time-homogeneous, because A and S are constants.

      C.6.4 Applications to Demand Forecasting
      The scalar model (with constant coefficients) is sometimes used for demand forecasting in a discrete­
      time setting. Here is one approach: At each time t, we forecast the demand during period t. Call the
      forecastf(t). This is a point estimate. The actual demand d(t) will typically deviate somewhat from
      the forecast. Call the deviation ee,) ~ de') - f(f). At time f + I, having observed d(I), compute the
      forecast for the next period (update the forecast) by

                                  f(1   +   1) = (1 - o.)f(f)             + o.d(I)~ f(l) + o.e(f)
      This approach is called exponential smoothing. The parameter a is called the smoothing constant;
      it is a positive number between 0 and 1. Thus, the updated forecast is a weighted average of the
      prior forecast and the actual, observed demand. If demand exceeds the forecast, so e(t) > 0, re­
      vise the forecast upward by the fixed fraction a of the deviation; conversely, a negative deviation
      reduces the forecast. The initial forecastf(O) = fa is some given constant.
           We can describe this procedure in terms of linear systems as follows: The state variable x(t) is
      the forecastf(t) itself. For now, think of the input as e(t) = e(t). So, the parameters are a = I and
      s ~ 0.. The actual demand is de,) ~ f(l) + e(l) ~ x(l) + (lIo.)e(I).
           We haven't made any assumptions about the deviations e(t) which drive the demands. But, con­
      sider under what conditions this technique makes sense: A good forecast should be unbiased,
      wbich means E[d(I)] ~ f(f), or E[e(I)] ~ O. Also, the forecast sbou1d take account fully of all cur­

..... dJe .. ,~As-        Exponential smoothing is a popular technique in practice, perhaps too popular, in my opinion.
                     It is certainly simple, and that is a virtue. And, it works well when the underlying model fits, i.e.,
.-.: Sio:e .." io    when the real demand is generated by something like the model above. Othcrwise, it may not. Un­
                     fortunately, it is sometimes presented as an all-purpose tool, appropriate for all occasions, free of
                     model assumptions and restrictions. It is not. Also. numerous (and conflicting) rules of thumb are
                     cheerfully proposed to seleet the smoothing constant. But rules of any kind are inappropriate here.
                     The smoothing constant is a model parameter, and it should be estimated like any other. This does
                     not mean that fancy methods are necessary; there is a role for simple heuristics in statistical esti­
                     mation, provided they are understood as such.
                          Notice too that the system here is unstable, since a = 1. In particular,

                                              d(l)   ~   e(')   + J(t)   ~   E(t)   + [o:e(' -    1) +J(t - I)]

                                                     = e(t)     + o:[e(l-      1)    + ... + e(O)] + J(O)

                     so V[d(t)J = (l + a t)V[e]. That is, the variance of future demand, as viewed from the present, is
:.-:s:               linearly increasing in t.
                         Another forecasting model is based on the first-order autoregressive process above. Suppose
                     there is a constant base demand d. Now, xCf + 1) represents the deviation of actual demand d(t)
                     from 4; i.e., x(t + 1) = d(t) - 4 and xeD) = Xo = D. The dynamics ofthcse deviations are given

                     where 0 < a < 1, so the system is stable. In these terms the forecast becomes [CO) = 4 and J(t)

                     x(t + 1). Now, however, x(t + I) depends not just on x(t), but also on the values at certain earlier
                     times, say x(t - 1) and x(t - 2). Also, it depends on sealar noise factors over several time periods,
                     say e(t) and e(t - 1). So, the stochastic process {x(t) : t ~ O} is certainly not a Markov proeess.

IX   and Jenlrins    The field ofinventory theory is notorious for notational inconsisteney, For example, a cursory scan
                     of the literature reveals a wealth of symbols (a. A, k, Fe, s, S, and others), all used to indicate a fixed
                     order cost. The symbols Rand s are both widely used to denote a reorder point, albeit in slightly
                     different contexts.
                         One does become aecustomed to this notational promiscuity after a while, but for those ap­
                     proaching the material for the first time, it imposes a significant extra burden. Even for veterans
                     it sometimes obscures ideas and the connections between them.
                        I have tried as best I can, therefore, to use consistent notational conventions throughout the
                     book. Here are some examples:
                          Lowerease letters are used throughout to indicate decision and policy variables. This is
                          consistent with common usage iu algebra, optimization. and mathematics generally. Thus, a
                          lot size is denoted q, even though Q is seen more often in the literature. Cost coefficients
                          and other constant parameters are also indicated by lower-case letters; k, not K or anything
                          else, is the fixed order cost. Upperease letters are reserved for important functions, random
                          variables, and stochastic proeesses, as well as matrices.
                          Boldface is used for vectors and stochastic processes.
                          I have tried to impose some eonsistency between deterministic and stochastic models, even
                          when this departs from eommon usage. Thus, oX. denotes an average demand rate
                          throughout, and ~ an average production rate, not just where they are commonly used in
                          this way (stochastic, continuous-time models), but also where they are not (like the EOQ
                          model).
                          Double letters indicate functions and processes associated with inventories (IN for net
                          inventory, IP for inventory position, etcetera). This is the only solution I have found for a
                          vexing problem: There are too many of these quantities, and they are all important. This
                          usage of character strings borrows from computer languages; students seem to get used to
                          the idea pretty quickly.
                         This approach has its drawbacks: lnstructors will have to adapt their thinking and their notes;
                     after the course, students will have to do some adapting to access the literature and to communi­
                     cate with colleagues. (The latter problem is inevitable anyway, because of the field's general no­
                     tational inconsistency.) For this I apologize.ln my view, however, these are small prices to pay to
                     avoid unneeessary obstacles to learning.
                         Consistency does have its limits, and 1 have run smack into one of them in selecting notation
                     for the discrete-time control models ofChaplers 4 and 9. There, inventory is essentially a deeision
                     variable, not a stochastic process. Should it be uppercase (as elsewhere in the book) or lowercase
                     (consistent with the convention above, as well as the bulk of the literature)? 1have chosen the see­
                     ond option. The result is tl't.'o symbols for inventory, I and x, in different places. Alas!
